But the focus on economic bases of elite opposition has obscured a second issue: co-optation benefits some elites at the expense of those who occupy disadvantaged positions in local patronage networks, inclining the latter to resist. This mechanism accounts for patterns of elite participation in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, a mass mobilization against state building in the postrevolutionary United States. Elites without patronage ties, and those whose clienteles overlapped with those of federal officers, were more likely to mobilize against the state.","1996","2022-05-23 08:36:21","2022-05-23 08:36:21","2022-05-23 08:29:40","400-429","","2","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: University of Chicago Press","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\PX6M3LK8\Gould - 1996 - Patron-Client Ties, State Centralization, and the .pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We study applicants to the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer project from two sites: the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Using network analysis, we develop a model of recruitment that predicts participation on the basis of the structural positions of individuals within the multiorganizational fields, as well as on the basis of individual background factors. We also study the role that the recruitment context plays, by comparing the results at these two universities. Independent of the individual background factors, structural position in the multiorganizational field predicts participation in Freedom Summer at Wisconsin, but not at Berkeley. The effects of individual background factors on participation are also contingent on the recruitment context. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results for the study of the effects of multiorganizational fields and recruitment contexts on participation in social movements.","1988-06-01","2022-05-23 09:06:31","2022-05-23 09:06:31","2022-05-23 09:06:31","357-382","","3","3","","Sociol Forum","Social networks and social movements","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Network Analysis; Social Issue; Social Movement; Social Network; Theoretical Implication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book traces the political aspects of this transformation step by step. The region's long allegiance to Jeffersonianism, was in part due to a group of plodding but shrewd politicians who remained in power until well after the War of 1812, before they were succeded by Hamiltonians. Ferguson profiles the major politicians and political events in the region from Revolutionary War times until the 1820s.","1938-03-15","2022-05-23 09:06:04","2022-05-23 09:06:04","","","328","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=T-8K89LcOlEC","","History / General; History / United States / State & Local / Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Class-collaborative rebellions correlate highly with a mode of production that makes for cooperative interests and interclass dependence, while class-conflict rebellions correlate highly with a mode of production that makes for antagonistic interests and interclass independence. But class-collaboration was unlikely without a target, which the state provided. Yet the state became the target in subsistence regions where the lack of markets made the raising of tax revenues particularly difficult and where subsistence classes were not dependent on the state for markets and, therefore, had little incentive to cooperate with the state. On the other hand, in regions with a commercial mode of production, raising tax revenues was less burdensome and classes tended to be dependent on the state for markets and, therefore, less likely to engage in antistate collective action.","1985-07-01","2022-05-23 09:01:20","2022-05-23 09:01:20","2022-05-23 09:01:20","445-468","","4","14","","Theor Soc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Collective Action; Crucial Issue; Mutual Dependence; Regional Mode; Similar Mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Karen Barkey shows how Turkish strategies of incorporating peasants and rotating elites kept both groups dependent on the state, unable and unwilling to rebel. Bandits, formerly mercenary soldiers, were not interested in rebellion but concentrated on trying to gain state resources, more as rogue clients than as primitive rebels. The state's ability to control and manipulate bandits—through deals, bargains and patronage—suggests imperial strength rather than weakness, she maintains.","2018-10-18","2022-05-23 08:52:42","2022-05-23 08:52:42","2022-05-23 08:52:42","","","","","","","Bandits and Bureaucrats","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.7591/9781501720871 Publication Title: Bandits and Bureaucrats","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\5USDTCS8\Barkey - 2018 - Bandits and Bureaucrats The Ottoman Route to Stat.pdf","","","History; Middle East Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brian","The Economy As An Evolving Complex System II","","978-0-429-97626-1","","","","A new view of the economy as an evolving, complex system has been pioneered at the Santa Fe Institute over the last ten years, This volume is a collection of articles that shape and define this view?a view of the economy as emerging from the interactions of individual agents whose behavior constantly evolves, whose strategies and actions are always adapting.The traditional framework in economics portrays activity within an equilibrium steady state. The interacting agents in the economy are typically homogenous, solve well-defined problems using perfect rationality, and act within given legal and social structures. The complexity approach, by contrast, sees economic activity as continually changing?continually in process. The interacting agents are typically heterogeneous, they must cognitively interpret the problems they face, and together they create the structures?markets, legal and social institutions, price patters, expectations?to which they individually react. Such structures may never settle down. Agents may forever adapt and explore and evolve their behaviors within structures that continually emerge and change and disappear?structures these behaviors co-create. This complexity approach does not replace the equilibrium one?it complements it.The papers here collected originated at a recent conference at the Santa Fe Institute, which was called to follow up the well-known 1987 SFI conference organized by Philip Anderson, Kenneth Arrow, and David Pines. They survey the new study of complexity and the economy. They apply this approach to real economic problems and they show the extent to which the initial vision of the 1987 conference has come to fruition.","2018-05-04","2022-05-23 08:49:30","2022-05-23 08:49:30","","","428","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5EpnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=5EpnDwAAQBAJ","","Mathematics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Picking up from where its companion volume, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, left off, Lineages traces the development of Absolutist states in the early modern period from their roots in European feudalism, and assesses their various trajectories. Why didn’t Italy develop into an Absolutist state in the same, indigenous way as the other dominant Western countries, namely Spain, France and England? On the other hand, how did Eastern European countries develop into Absolutist states similar to those of the West, when their social conditions diverged so drastically? Reflecting on examples in Islamic and East Asian history, as well as the Ottoman Empire, Anderson concludes by elucidating the particular role of European development within universal history.","2013-04-29","2022-05-23 08:48:45","2022-05-23 08:48:45","","","582","","","","","","","","","","Verso Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: V2vnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=V2vnDwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / General; Political Science / Constitutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LSNZKVQ5","book","1995","Gould, Roger V.","Insurgent Identities: Class, Community, and Protest in Paris from 1848 to the Commune","","978-0-226-30560-8","","","","In this important contribution both to the study of social protest and to French social history, Roger Gould breaks with previous accounts that portray the Paris Commune of 1871 as a continuation of the class struggles of the 1848 Revolution. Focusing on the collective identities framing conflict during these two upheavals and in the intervening period, Gould reveals that while class played a pivotal role in 1848, it was neighborhood solidarity that was the decisive organizing force in 1871.  The difference was due to Baron Haussmann's massive urban renovation projects between 1852 and 1868, which dispersed workers from Paris's center to newly annexed districts on the outskirts of the city. In these areas, residence rather than occupation structured social relations. Drawing on evidence from trail documents, marriage records, reports of police spies, and the popular press, Gould demonstrates that this fundamental rearrangement in the patterns of social life made possible a neighborhood insurgent movement; whereas the insurgents of 1848 fought and died in defense of their status as workers, those in 1871 did so as members of a besieged urban community.  A valuable resource for historians and scholars of social movements, this work shows that collective identities vary with political circumstances but are nevertheless constrained by social networks. Gould extends this argument to make sense of other protest movements and to offer predictions about the dimensions of future social conflict.","1995-12","2022-05-23 09:26:59","2022-05-23 09:26:59","","","272","","","","","Insurgent Identities","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Fbrf8i0NIu4C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=Fbrf8i0NIu4C","","History / Asia / Japan; History / Europe / France; Social Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book traces the political aspects of this transformation step by step. The region's long allegiance to Jeffersonianism, was in part due to a group of plodding but shrewd politicians who remained in power until well after the War of 1812, before they were succeded by Hamiltonians. Ferguson profiles the major politicians and political events in the region from Revolutionary War times until the 1820s.","1938-03-15","2022-05-23 09:25:37","2022-05-23 09:25:37","","","328","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=T-8K89LcOlEC","","History / General; History / United States / State & Local / Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this first volume, Michael Mann examines inter-relations between these elements from neolithic times, through ancient Near Eastern civilizations, the classical Mediterranean age, and medieval Europe, up to just before the Industrial Revolution in England. It offers explanations of the emergence of the state and social stratification; of city-states, militaristic empires, and the persistent interaction between them; of the world salvation religions; and of the particular dynamism of medieval and early modern Europe. It ends by generalizing about the nature of overall social development, the varying forms of social cohesion, and the role of classes and class struggle in history.

The ""Whiskey Rebellion"" marked the first large-scale resistance to a law of the U.S. government under the Constitution. This classic confrontation between champions of liberty and defenders of order was long considered the most significant event in the first quarter-century of the new nation. Thomas P. Slaughter recaptures the historical drama and significance of this violent episode in which frontier West and cosmopolitan East battled over the meaning of the American Revolution. The book not only offers the broadest and most comprehensive account of the Whiskey Rebellion ever written, taking into account the political, social and intellectual contexts of the time, but also challenges conventional understandings of the Revolutionary era.","1986-09-04","2022-05-23 09:34:34","2022-05-23 09:34:34","","","300","","","","","The Whiskey Rebellion","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=G1S-pGtzCOcC","","History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies); History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From France in the 1790s to Vietnam in the 1970s, social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the outcomes of such revolutions. And it develops in depth a rigorous, comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, the author urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to explanations of revolutions.","1979-02-28","2022-05-23 09:34:19","2022-07-01 04:37:26","","","436","","","","","States and Social Revolutions","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: so0gddc0w3UC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=so0gddc0w3UC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Revolutionary; Political Science / Political Freedom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"4CWESL22","book","1984","Eisenstadt, Shmuel Noah; Roniger, Luis","Patrons, Clients and Friends: Interpersonal Relations and the Structure of Trust in Society","","978-0-521-28890-3","","","","The form of social relations described by the terms 'patronage' and 'patron-client relations' is of central concern to sociologists, anthropologists and political scientists today. Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 09:43:34","2022-07-01 04:48:13","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why do we always miss turning points as they transpire? When does what doesn't happen mean as much, if not more, than what does? Andrew Abbott considers these fascinating questions in Time Matters, a diverse series of essays that constitutes the most extensive analysis of temporality in social science today. Ranging from abstract theoretical reflection to pointed methodological critique, Abbott demonstrates the inevitably theoretical character of any methodology.  Time Matters focuses particularly on questions of time, events, and causality. Abbott grounds each essay in straightforward examinations of actual social scientific analyses. Throughout, he demonstrates the crucial assumptions we make about causes and events, about actors and interaction and about time and meaning every time we employ methods of social analysis, whether in academic disciplines, market research, public opinion polling, or even evaluation research. Turning current assumptions on their heads, Abbott not only outlines the theoretical orthodoxies of empirical social science, he sketches new alternatives, laying down foundations for a new body of social theory.","2001-07-15","2022-05-23 09:43:11","2022-05-23 09:43:11","","","329","","","","","Time Matters","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: lVmkHsEo3CsC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=lVmkHsEo3CsC","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Social Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It then considers how the ABC method differs from an earlier generation of modeling approaches, including game theory, equation-based models of computer simulation (such as system dynamics), and multivariate linear models. It also discusses potential weaknesses of ABC modeling and proposes research strategies to address them.

However, there are many countries where politicians win elections by giving money, jobs, and services in direct exchange for votes. This is not just true in the developing world, but also in economically developed countries - such as Japan and Austria - that clearly meet the definition of stable, modern democracies. This book offers explanations for why politicians engage in clientelistic behaviours and why voters respond. Using newly collected data on national and sub-national patterns of patronage and electoral competition, the contributors demonstrate why explanations based on economic modernization or electoral institutions cannot account for international variation in patron-client and programmatic competition. Instead, they show how the interaction of economic development, party competition, governance of the economy, and ethnic heterogeneity may work together to determine the choices of patrons, clients and policies.","2007-03-29","2022-05-23 09:49:28","2022-07-01 04:19:30","","","344","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Policies","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oKs6oahqfjoC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=oKs6oahqfjoC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.","2002","2022-05-23 09:52:08","2022-05-23 09:52:08","2022-05-23 09:52:08","143-166","","1","28","","","From Factors to Actors","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141117","","","","","cellular automata; complexity; emergence; genetic algorithm; self-organization; simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Offering major insights into the building blocks of social life, it identifies which locally emergent structures have the capacity to grow into larger ones and shows how structural tendencies associated with smaller structures shape and constrain patterns of larger structures. The book then investigates the role such structures have played in the emergence of the modern nation-state. Bringing together the latest findings in sociology, anthropology, political science, and history, John Levi Martin traces how sets of interpersonal relationships become ordered in different ways to form structures. He looks at a range of social structures, from smaller ones like families and street gangs to larger ones such as communes and, ultimately, nation-states. He finds that the relationships best suited to forming larger structures are those that thrive in conditions of inequality; that are incomplete and as sparse as possible, and thereby avoid the problem of completion in which interacting members are required to establish too many relationships; and that abhor transitivity rather than assuming it. Social Structures argues that these ""patronage"" relationships, which often serve as means of loose coordination in the absence of strong states, are nevertheless the scaffolding of the social structures most distinctive to the modern state, namely the command army and the political party.","2009-07-27","2022-05-23 09:52:24","2022-05-23 09:52:24","2022-05-23 09:52:24","","","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400830534 Publication Title: Social Structures","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\KD9ZQG6X\Martin - 2009 - Social Structures.pdf","","","Wealth; Aggression; Agonism; American Sociological Review; Analogy; Asymmetry; Balance theory; Benefice; Binary relation; Bystander effect; Centrality; Chimpanzee; Claude Lévi-Strauss; Command hierarchy; Commoner; Competition; Consideration; Cousin marriage; Credibility; De facto; Determination; Dominance hierarchy; Egalitarianism; Emergence; Employment; Eviatar Zerubavel; Exchange of women; Explanation; Feudalism; Formal organization; Governance; Harrison White; Heuristic; Household; Ideology; Incentive; Informant; Institution; Interpersonal relationship; Intransitivity; Kinship; Matrilineality; Mercenary; Nation state; Nobility; Obligation; Oligarchy; Organization; Ownership; Participant; Party system; Patrilineality; Patronage; Political machine; Political party; Political structure; Politician; Politics; Popularity; Power structure; Preferential attachment; Probability; Quantity; Requirement; Result; Retinue; Ruler; Scaffolding; Shortage; Sibling; Small-world experiment; Social Action; Social actions; Social distance; Social order; Social organization; Social relation; Social research; Social science; Social space; Social status; Social structure; Social theory; Society; Sociology; Spoils system; Spouse; State (polity); State formation; State socialism; Structural analysis; Subset; Tax; Terminology; The Other Hand; Theory; Trade-off; Tree structure; Vassal; Warfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What they rarely learn, however, is how to actually theorize. The Art of Social Theory is a practical guide to doing just that. In this one-of-a-kind user's manual for social theorists, Richard Swedberg explains how theorizing occurs in what he calls the context of discovery, a process in which the researcher gathers preliminary data and thinks creatively about it using tools such as metaphor, analogy, and typology. He guides readers through each step of the theorist’s art, from observation and naming to concept formation and explanation. To theorize well, you also need a sound knowledge of existing social theory. Swedberg introduces readers to the most important theories and concepts, and discusses how to go about mastering them.

"2N595RLS","book","2013","Cross, William P.; Katz, Richard S.","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy","","978-0-19-163800-8","","","","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy provides a comprehensive examination of both the concept and the practice of intra-party democracy (IPD). Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms — particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications. Comparative Politics is a series for students, teachers, and researchers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour. The series is published in association with the European Consortium for Political Research. For more information visit: www.ecprnet.eu. The Comparative Politics series is edited by Professor David M. Farrell, School of Politics and International Relations, University College Dublin, and Kenneth Carty, Professor of Political Science, University of British Columbia.","2013-02-28","2022-05-23 10:03:21","2022-05-23 10:03:21","","","220","","","","","","","","","","OUP Oxford","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: lUhoAgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=lUhoAgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SVNJAYKV","book","1984","Eisenstadt, Shmuel Noah; Roniger, Luis","Patrons, Clients and Friends: Interpersonal Relations and the Structure of Trust in Society","","978-0-521-28890-3","","","","The form of social relations described by the terms 'patronage' and 'patron-client relations' is of central concern to sociologists, anthropologists and political scientists today. Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 10:04:07","2022-07-04 03:15:39","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UIMT5XFV","book","1998","Hutchcroft, Paul David","Booty Capitalism: The Politics of Banking in the Philippines","","978-0-8014-3428-0","","","","In the early postwar years, the Philippines seemed poised for long-term economic success; within the region, only Japan had a higher standard of living. By the early 1990s, however, the country was dismissed as a perennial aspirant to the ranks of newly industrializing economies, unable to convert its substantial developmental assets into developmental success. Major reforms of the mid-1990s bring new hope, explains Paul D. Hutchcroft, but accompanying economic gains remain relatively modest and short-lived. What has gone wrong? The Philippines should have all the ingredients for developmental success: tremendous entrepreneurial talents; a well-educated and anglophone workforce; a rich endowment of natural resources; a vibrant community of economists and development specialists; and abundant overseas assistance. Hutchcroft attributes the laggard economic performance to long-standing deficiencies in the Philippine political sphere. The country's experience, he asserts, illuminates the relationship between political and economic development in the modern Third World. Through careful examination of interactions between the state and the major families of the oligarchy in the banking sector since 1960, Hutchcroft shows the political obstacles to Philippine development. ""Booty capitalism,"" he explains, emerged from relations between a patrimonial state and a predatory oligarchy. Hutchcroft concludes by examining the capacity of recent reform efforts to encourage transformation toward a political, economic order more responsive to the developmental needs of the Philippine nation as a whole.","1998","2022-05-23 10:07:13","2022-05-23 10:07:13","","","308","","","","","Booty Capitalism","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IqlmT6BsFoQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=IqlmT6BsFoQC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Banks & Banking; History / Asia / Southeast Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He also offers an extensive review of the concept and rationale of the political party, and develops a sharp critique of various spatial models of party competition. This is political science at its best – combining the intelligent use of theory with sophisticated analytic arguments, and grounding all of this on a substantial cross-national empirical base. Parties and Party Systems is one of the classics of postwar political science, and is now established as the foremost work in its field.","2005","2022-05-23 10:17:10","2022-05-23 10:17:10","","","368","","","","","Parties and Party Systems","","","","","ECPR Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ywr0CcGDNHwC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This view is based on a narrow procedural definition of institutions that makes more sense in democratic than in authoritarian settings. While democratic institutions consist largely of procedures that constrain the executive's despotic power, authoritarian institutions consist primarily of organizations that enhance the regime's infrastructural power over political opposition. The practical significance of this distinction can be seen in the personalization of power in Malaysia. An aspiring autocrat ironically took advantage of highly institutionalized political organizations to enhance his personal power, even while maintaining the regime's resilience in the face of pressures for democratization.","2003","2022-05-23 10:22:21","2022-05-23 10:22:21","2022-05-23 10:22:21","81-101","","1","36","","","Iron Cage in an Iron Fist","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Comparative Politics, Ph.D. Programs in Political Science, City University of New York","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\P3NHGZWJ\Slater - 2003 - Iron Cage in an Iron Fist Authoritarian Instituti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro, Identity and Control presents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.","2012-11-21","2022-05-23 10:23:28","2022-05-23 10:23:28","2022-05-23 10:23:28","","","","","","","Identity and Control","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400845903 Publication Title: Identity and Control","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\KCGQ7LF2\White - 2012 - Identity and Control How Social Formations Emerge.pdf","","","Analogy; Asymmetry; Consideration; Emergence; Explanation; Formal organization; Governance; Heuristic; Ideology; Institution; Kinship; Organization; Participant; Politics; Result; Social actions; Social organization; Social relation; Social science; Social space; Social structure; Social theory; Sociology; The Other Hand; Theory; Trade-off; Accounting; Actor–network theory; Ambiguity; Bounded rationality; Calculation; Career; Case study; Causality; Clientelism; Colonialism; Complex society; Corporatism; Creation myth; Decentralization; Demography; Devolution; Dystopia; Embedding; Engineering; Externality; Grammar; Habitus (sociology); Hegemony; High- and low-level; Holism; Ideal type; Illustration; Inference; Information asymmetry; Interconnection; Jargon; Liminality; Management styles; Measurement; Medium of exchange; Michael Polanyi; Mimetic isomorphism; Mismatch; Modernity; Multiple discovery; Narrative; Obfuscation; Opportunism; Orderliness; Orwellian; Personhood; Plural society; Positioning (marketing); Prediction; Profession; Professionalization; Public sphere; Quid Pro Quo; Rational choice theory; Rationality; Rhetoric; Sensibility; Social constructionism; Social environment; Social reality; Sociocultural evolution; Sophistication; Stage theory; Structuring; Subculture; Superiority (short story); The Philosopher; Transfer pricing; Triage; Unbundling; Uncertainty; Venality; War; Working hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In December 2008 the National Democratic Congress (NDC) regained political power, and within months rifts appeared over the allocation of ministerial portfolios. The intra-party murmurings became public when two factions supported rival candidacies for the party's presidential nomination. The pro-Rawlings faction supported the candidacy of Nana Konadu Agyemang-Rawlings, and the anti-Rawlings bloc backed President John Evans Atta Mills. Drawing on Boucek's (2009) typology of factionalism, this article argues that factionalism within the NDC is a dynamic and complex process of informal groupings competing and jockeying for power to satisfy members' interests. It draws three conclusions: party factions are ad hoc groupings that are nurtured into a power bloc, and are constellated around particular individuals; factional conflicts are not rooted in ideology, but are based on differences in policy goals, interests and patronage; and, finally, factionalism fluctuates between cooperative and competitive phases.","2012-12","2022-05-23 10:26:30","2022-05-23 10:26:30","2022-05-23 10:26:30","573-601","","4","50","","","Party factions and power blocs in Ghana","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bridging existing literatures, the authors analyse dominant parties at national and sub-national, district and intra-party levels and take a fresh look at some of the classic cases of one-party dominance. The book also features methodological advances in the study of dominant parties through contributions that develop new ways of conceptualizing and measuring one-party dominance. Combining theoretical and empirical research and bringing together leading experts in the field - including Hermann Giliomee and Kenneth Greene - this book features comparisons and case studies on Japan, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Italy, France and South Africa.

However, these analyses largely overlook the process of candidate recruitment and selection, an issue intricately tied to political outcomes and the functioning of democracy. In this volume, a team of experts uses a common analytic framework developed by the editors to analyze the recruitment and selection of executive and legislative candidates in six major countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. It does so from two perspectives. First, as a dependent variable, the volume explores the party and legal factors that drive the recruitment and selection process, thus producing particular types of candidates. It then considers candidate type as an independent variable, analyzing the impact of candidate type on campaigns, political parties, and the behavior of legislators and presidents once elected. The result is the first fully comparative inquiry into a central, but largely neglected, determinant of politics in Latin America.","2012-03-31","2022-05-23 10:29:33","2022-05-23 10:29:33","","","462","","","","","Pathways to Power","","","","","Penn State Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6di7zeTbjIQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=6di7zeTbjIQC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploiting two recently built datasets that estimated the policy positions of Italian parties and factions from 1946 to 2010, we investigate if and to what extent factions bind the party leader in choosing the platform. We find confirmation for the idea that party positions are linked to factional preferences. Overall, the party works as a ‘bounded oligarchy’. Furthermore, the electoral payoff of party unity increases the impact of factional constraints when general elections approach. In line with the cartel party theory, however, autonomous leaders who are directly elected by a wider selectorate can get rid of factional ties choosing more moderate and vote-maximizing platforms.","2012-12-01","2022-05-23 10:30:27","2022-05-23 10:30:27","2022-05-23 10:30:27","689-701","","4","31","","Electoral Studies","Bounded oligarchy","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Italy; Cartel party; Content analysis; Downs; Factions; Party position taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 10:35:06","2022-07-04 03:15:53","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these analyses largely overlook the process of candidate recruitment and selection, an issue intricately tied to political outcomes and the functioning of democracy. In this volume, a team of experts uses a common analytic framework developed by the editors to analyze the recruitment and selection of executive and legislative candidates in six major countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. It does so from two perspectives. First, as a dependent variable, the volume explores the party and legal factors that drive the recruitment and selection process, thus producing particular types of candidates. It then considers candidate type as an independent variable, analyzing the impact of candidate type on campaigns, political parties, and the behavior of legislators and presidents once elected. The result is the first fully comparative inquiry into a central, but largely neglected, determinant of politics in Latin America.","2012-03-31","2022-05-23 10:39:47","2022-05-23 10:39:47","","","462","","","","","Pathways to Power","","","","","Penn State Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6di7zeTbjIQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=6di7zeTbjIQC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"C9GM5SGE","journalArticle","","Mukwedeya, Tatenda Godswill","Intraparty Politics and the Local State: Factionalism, Patronage and Power in Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality.","","","","","","The thesis observes that the ANC’s political dominance after 1994 saw the gradual conflation of the party and state partly through two processes related the party’s transformative agenda. Firstly, the state itself had to be transformed to reflect the demographic composition of the country and for the most part the ANC deployed its cadres into the state who could tow the party line. Secondly, the party relied on the state as a vehicle for redistribution and the transformation of the broader political economy to achieve equity and growth. Hence black economic empowerment, state preferential procurement and other policies to uplift previously disadvantaged social groups became stepping stones for the emergent African middle and upper class. Whilst these processes transformed the state, they also fundamentally transformed the party itself as it became a site of accumulation. Intraparty contestation intensified over the limited opportunities for upward mobility provided by access to the state. The thesis argues that factionalism increasingly became characterised by patronage as competing groups within the party sought to ring-fence their political power and the opportunities for upward mobility provided by the state. This was also compounded by deepening neoliberalism whose consequences of unemployment, poverty and inequality especially at the local level led to increased dependence on the local state and the development of factionalism based on patronage politics. The thesis then explores how patronage operates in everyday practice at the local level. It shows how patron-client relationships are not merely the exchange of state resources for political support but rather they embody a field of power relations (Auyero 2001). Evidence from Buffalo City offers an important insight into how patronage exchanges are preceded by complex relationships of power that are established over time and through various enactments. The thesis demonstrates how patrons, brokers and clients exercise various forms of power every day that inform inclusion or exclusion into networks for distributing scarce state resources. It challenges views that regard factionalism and patronage as elite driven practices.","","2022-05-23 10:40:53","2022-05-23 10:40:53","","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\22QJFYER\Mukwedeya - Intraparty Politics and the Local State Factional.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where do new alternatives, new organizational forms, and new types of people come from? Combining biochemical insights about the origin of life with innovative and historically oriented social network analyses, John Padgett and Walter Powell develop a theory about the emergence of organizational, market, and biographical novelty from the coevolution of multiple social networks. They demonstrate that novelty arises from spillovers across intertwined networks in different domains. In the short run actors make relations, but in the long run relations make actors. This theory of novelty emerging from intersecting production and biographical flows is developed through formal deductive modeling and through a wide range of original historical case studies. Padgett and Powell build on the biochemical concept of autocatalysis--the chemical definition of life--and then extend this autocatalytic reasoning to social processes of production and communication. Padgett and Powell, along with other colleagues, analyze a very wide range of cases of emergence. They look at the emergence of organizational novelty in early capitalism and state formation; they examine the transformation of communism; and they analyze with detailed network data contemporary science-based capitalism: the biotechnology industry, regional high-tech clusters, and the open source community.","2012-10-14","2022-05-23 10:41:55","2022-07-04 03:23:15","2022-05-23 10:41:55","","","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400845552 Publication Title: The Emergence of Organizations and Markets","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\PNXY9P7X\Padgett 그리고 Powell - 2012 - The Emergence of Organizations and Markets.pdf","","","China; democracy; social networks; political parties; Russia; social science; agent-based model; altruism; altruistic reproduction; autocatalysis; autocatalytic reasoning; autocracy; autopoiesis; biochemistry; biochemistry literature; biographical autocatalysis; biographical novelty; biotechnology companies; biotechnology industry; Boris Yeltsin; business alliances; business groups; Calvinism; capitalism; cellular autocatalysis; cellular companies; cellular phone industry; chemistry; commercial capitalism; communism; communist economic reform; conflict displacement; corporate merchant-banks; depoliticized market; dual inclusion; Eastern Europe; economic development; economic experimentation; economic production; economic reform; economic reform campaigns; economic reforms; empirical chemistry; financial markets; Florence; Florentine international finance; Florentine partnership systems; foreign investment; formal models; genealogical communication; German nationalism; Germany; high-tech clusters; homology; human organizations; Hungarian economy; hypercycle model; hypercycles; interenterprise networks; international trade; interorganizational network formation; joint-stock company; lateral control; linguistic autocatalysis; market formation; market reform policies; metabolism-first hypothesis; migration; mobile telecom market; molecular biology; multiple social networks; multiple-network ensemble; Netherlands; noble kinship; open source community; organizational genesis; organizational innovations; organizational novelty; origin of life; patronage; political settlement; privatization; production autocatalysis; Prussia; public peer pressure; refunctionality; Renaissance; RNA-first hypothesis; social sequence analysis; Soviet Union; state finance; state formation; state ownership; state planning system; state socialism collapse; stigmergy; structural vulnerability; symbolic communication; tipping; transposition; Tuscan merchant-banks; Tuscany; university science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MUC5VHWQ","book","2013","Cross, William P.; Katz, Richard S.","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy","","978-0-19-163800-8","","","","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy provides a comprehensive examination of both the concept and the practice of intra-party democracy (IPD). Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms — particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications. Comparative Politics is a series for students, teachers, and researchers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour. The series is published in association with the European Consortium for Political Research. For more information visit: www.ecprnet.eu. The Comparative Politics series is edited by Professor David M.

"2CFV629T","webpage","2014","Simral, Vit","The cost of partitocracy: party funding in East Central Europe","","","","","https://e-theses.imtlucca.it/154/","The work’s goal is to contribute to the discussion on cartelisation in the party systems of East Central Europe. Its contribution to the research field is to be found in a thorough analysis of the budgets of political parties in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, to a smaller degree also of the budgets of political parties in Austria, Germany and Slovenia. In total thirty arguments found in the existing scholarly literature are discussed, with a focus on their relation to budgets and election strategies of political parties. These arguments are analysed with the help of basic tools of quantivative statistical analysis and the qualitative method of comparison of selected features of the analysed cases. The work’s analytical part is based on two new original datasets. The first one, where data on budgets of political parties are collected, uses publicly available sources found in both the off-line as well as the on-line world of today. The second one uses original data collected by the means of an electronic questionnaire send to representatives of political parties in the six researched countries. The work defines two new concepts that serve as the theoretical basis of the analysis: the rule drive and the strategy drive. The rule drive is the part of a party’s budget that is predominantly formed by legal regulations on political parties, their funding and activities. On the income side, the rule drive is mostly visible in the share of party budget comprised by state subsidies. On the expenditure side, the rule drive is most apparent in the legal limits of expenses parties may allocate to election campaigning. In addition, the rule drive encompasses also the various limits on donations permittable to be accepted by political parties, limits on parties‘ business activities, or the legal fees that parties are obliged to pay to enter certain types of elections. The strategy drive is the causal agent that is predominantly formed by parties‘ free decisions on how they wish to conduct their day-to-day activities and their election campaigning. On the income side, the strategy drive is represented by the amount of membership fees collected, donations accepted or loans taken out. On the expenditure side, the strategy drive is the formula by which political parties allocate their financial assets to the various activities each political party carries out: office operations, administrative work for their elected representatives and officials, education of party members and promotion towards the public in general, election campaigning. Both concepts are of interest for the analysis and all their segments are used to assess the various structural features of party budgets. Original data collected for the work show that parties in their lifetime go through an evolution of their budgets, from one relying mostly on private donations and spending the majority of assets on elections to one relying on membership fees, state subsidies in the case of an electoral sucess, and spending a larger part of assets on activities not related to election campaigning. The specific shape of budget evolution depends largely on the size of their budget – parties with smaller budgets feature also a different budget structure than parties with budgets larger. This rule applies across the spectrum, from the largest parties in the dataset to the smallest one. The quantitative data on budget sizes are in the work translated into meaningful, categories based on budget sizes. , The categories are labeled weight classes, mimicking the weight classes found in the boxing world, from bantamweight parties, with annual budgets up to €10 thousand, to super heavyweight parties, with annual budgets over €10 million. All parties in the researched countries are thus be classified. Based on these categories, is it shown that the largest, super heavy parties in East Central Europe receive the bulk of all public funding. The model of subsidies distribution differs in the researched countries and the numbers show that it is difficult to assess whether one system is more cartelised than the other on the basis of distributed state subsidies. Easier and less arguable is to assess the relative transparency of the models of party regulations and regulations of party funding in each of the researched country. Austria, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia and Poland are in the recent time undergoing a turn towards more transparency, with new laws already in place or currently being adopted. The Czech Republic is noticeably lagging behind. The last phenomenon discussed in the work is that certain features of budgets, including its size and structure, correlate with certain party strategies. Parties of certain budget size and structure have different campaigning strategies, different policies and different opinions than parties of different budget size and structure. The collected data shows links between several variables, such as parties with large subsidies share in their budgets see as legitimate larger subsidies share than parties without subsidies, or heavyweight and middleweight parties spend a significantly larger share of their election expenses on the Internet than super heavyweight parties. Finally is discussed the behaviour of a specific set of parties that are in the researched dataset mostly found in the heavyweight and middleweight class. These parties have different campaign strategies, keep their election campaign spending higher than the rest and their budgets do not go through the same evolutionary shift as do the budgets of other parties. They do not increase their fee-paying membership and do not sustain significant day-to-day activities not directly related to election campaigning. These parties are since 2007 at the latest most successful in challenging the ‘cartel’ established by larger parties in national parliaments. The set of these parties overlaps in a large part with the set of ‘populist’ parties as discussed in other, ideology and party programme-oriented literature. Or, if restated, the populist parties are in their majority distinguished not only by their programmatic profile, but also by the structure of their budgets and related party strategy features. Ultimately, the work provides a lot of empirical evidence for the discussion of the concept of ‘cartel’ in the region of East Central Europe. It supports with hard data some of the old folk theorems and creates a firm data and conceptual basis for further research of party funding in East Central Europe.","2014-12","2022-05-23 10:46:26","2022-05-23 10:46:26","2022-05-23 10:46:26","","","","","","","The cost of partitocracy","","","","","","","en","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","","","","","Num Pages: 153 Publisher: IMT Alti Studi Lucca","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\4CGHHKEW\Simral - 2014 - The cost of partitocracy party funding in East Ce.pdf; C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\SSBJHHM9\154.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It draws on fieldwork that included 71 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with party representatives and ordinary members (23 in Zambia, 24 in Burundi, and 24 in Togo). The interviews were conducted mostly in provincial urban centres over a period of four months in 2011 and 2012. The study conceives political parties as strategically acting organizations embedded in unique socio-political contexts; it argues that two hitherto neglected terms are especially useful for understanding and comparing them: cohesion and party-voter linkage. The argument is grounded on three key features of sub-Saharan party politics: a hostile operating environment, the prevalence of face-to-face political communication, and the supposed absence of ideology (which is re-interpreted as the presence of a single dominant ideology - development). The study conceptualizes cohesion as a prerequisite of Panebianco's (1988) institutionalization. A new, expanded classification of party – voter linkage types is formulated and a distinction is made between linkage proper and the genre in which it is enacted. Cohesion and linkage are combined in a comparative framework that enables generation of specific hypotheses about parties’ behaviour.","2014-01-22","2022-05-23 10:46:39","2022-05-23 10:46:39","2022-05-23 10:46:39","","","","","","","Political Parties in Zambia, Burundi and Togo","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2483987","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\4BARRIGV\Tobolka - 2014 - Political Parties in Zambia, Burundi and Togo Org.pdf","","","Burundi; cohesion; linkage; organization; Political parties; Togo; Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2483987","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"EDZP4AAH","book","2013","Cross, William P.; Katz, Richard S.","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy","","978-0-19-163800-8","","","","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy provides a comprehensive examination of both the concept and the practice of intra-party democracy (IPD). Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms — particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications.

Chaos of Disciplines reconsiders how knowledge actually changes and advances. Challenging the accepted belief that social sciences are in a perpetual state of progress, Abbott contends that disciplines instead cycle around an inevitable pattern of core principles. New schools of thought, then, are less a reaction to an established order than they are a reinvention of fundamental concepts. Chaos of Disciplines uses fractals to explain the patterns of disciplines, and then applies them to key debates that surround the social sciences. Abbott argues that knowledge in different disciplines is organized by common oppositions that function at any level of theoretical or methodological scale. Opposing perspectives of thought and method, then, in fields ranging from history, sociology, and literature, are to the contrary, radically similar; much like fractals, they are each mutual reflections of their own distinctions.","2010-07-15","2022-05-30 10:03:11","2022-05-30 10:03:11","2022-05-30 10:03:11","","","","","","","","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.7208/9780226001050 Publication Title: Chaos of Disciplines","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\GEZ23WSZ\Abbott - 2010 - Chaos of Disciplines.pdf","","","interdisciplinary; methodology; conflict; knowledge; capitalism; history; academia; analysis; anthropology; choice; consensus; constraint; constructionism; determinism; discourse; feminism; freedom; humanities; literature; marxism; narrative; nonfiction; philosophy; scholarship; similarity; social sciences; sociology; solidarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The metropolitan principals of these organizations faced special problems in monitoring and controlling their own colonial agents. Focusing primarily on the Dutch United East Indies Company and secondarily on its English counterpart, I argue that the network structure of each organization affected the degree to which relationships between patrimonial principals and their agents could serve as a disciplinary device. Dutch decline was imminent when alternative opportunities for private gain, available via the ascending English East India Company, allowed Dutch colonial servants to evade their own patrimonial chain and encouraged its organizational breakdown. Features of network structure determined whether colonial agents saw better alternatives to the official patrimonial hierarchy, when they could act on them, and whether principals could respond.","1996","2022-05-30 10:07:05","2022-05-30 10:07:05","2022-05-30 10:07:05","12-28","","1","61","","","Principals and Agents, Colonialists and Company Men","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [American Sociological Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\DUT448HX\Adams - 1996 - Principals and Agents, Colonialists and Company Me.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the course of eighty years, the tiny United Provinces of the Netherlands overthrew Spanish rule and became Europe's dominant power. Eventually, though, Dutch hegemony collapsed as quickly as it had risen. In The Familial State, Julia Adams explores the role that Holland's great families played in this dramatic history. She charts how family patriarchs--who were at the time both state-builders and merchant capitalists--shaped the first great wave of European colonialism, which in turn influenced European political development in innovative ways.On the basis of massive archival work, Adams arrives at a profoundly gendered reading of the family/power structure of the Dutch elite and their companies, in particular the VOC or Dutch East India Company. In the United Provinces, she finds the first example of the power structure that would dominate the transitional states of early modern Europe--the familial state. This organizational structure is typified, in her view, by paternal political rule and multiple arrangements among the family heads.","2005","2022-05-30 10:07:22","2022-05-30 10:07:22","","","262","","","","","The Familial State","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Es3CpXHKEkUC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=Es3CpXHKEkUC","","Social Science / Sociology / General; History / Europe / Western; History / Modern / 17th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on eight years of intensive insider participant observation in their own children's community, Peter and Patti Adler discuss the vital components of the lives of preadolescents, popularity, friendships, cliques, social status, social isolation, loyalty, bullying, boy-girl relationships, and afterschool activities. They describe how friendships shift and change, how people are drawn into groups and excluded from them, how clique leaders maintain their power and popularity, and how individuals' social experiences and feelings about themselves differ from the top of the pecking order to the bottom. In so doing, the Adlers focus their attention on the peer culture of the children themselves and the way this culture extracts and modifies elements from adult culture. Children's peer culture, as it is nourished in those spaces where grown ups cannot penetrate, stands between individual children and the larger adult society. As such, it is a mediator and shaper, influencing the way children collectively interpret their surroundings and deal with the common problems they face.  The Adlers explore some of the patterns that develop in this social space, noting both the differences in boys' and girls' gendered cultures and the overlap in many social dynamics, afterschool activities, role behaviour, romantic inclinations and social stratification. For example, children's participation in adult-organized afterschool activities - a now-prominent feature of many American children's social experience - has profound implications for their socialization and development, moving them away from the negotiated, spontaneous character of play into the formal systems of adult norms and values at ever-younger ages. When they retreat from adults, however, they still display distinctive peer group dynamics, forging strong ingroup/outgroup differentiation, loyalty and identification. Peer culture thus contains informal social mechanisms through which children create their social order, determine their place and identity, and develop positive and negative feelings about themselves. Studying children's peer culture is thus valuable as it reveals not only how this subculture parallels the adult world but also how it differs from it.","1998","2022-05-30 10:09:17","2022-07-01 04:53:51","","","278","","","","","Peer Power","","","","","Rutgers University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wQZev_AsdpcC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=wQZev_AsdpcC","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Family & Relationships / Life Stages / School Age; Family & Relationships / Peer Pressure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In his study, historian John K. Alexander uses narrative history to argue that Samuel Adams was both America's first professional politician and its first modern politician. Adams, Alexander argues, was an unwavering politician who strove to protect the people's basic rights and who emphasized the importance of virtue, liberty, a sense of duty, and education in fashioning a republican society. John K. Alexander's fresh reading of Adams's record, and a uniquely close look into his personal life, uncovers a masterful politician and a man consistent in his beliefs.","2002","2022-05-30 10:10:15","2022-05-30 10:10:15","","","270","","","","","Samuel Adams","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: H39E42RWP18C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=H39E42RWP18C","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); Political Science / Political Process / Leadership; Biography & Autobiography / Historical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the Seven Years' War, Great Britain decisively eliminated French power north of the Caribbean — and in the process destroyed an American diplomatic system in which Native Americans had long played a central, balancing role — permanently changing the political and cultural landscape of North America.Anderson skillfully reveals the clash of inherited perceptions the war created when it gave thousands of American colonists their first experience of real Englishmen and introduced them to the British cultural and class system. We see colonists who assumed that they were partners in the empire encountering British officers who regarded them as subordinates and who treated them accordingly. This laid the groundwork in shared experience for a common view of the world, of the empire, and of the men who had once been their masters. Thus, Anderson shows, the war taught George Washington and other provincials profound emotional lessons, as well as giving them practical instruction in how to be soldiers.Depicting the subsequent British efforts to reform the empire and American resistance — the riots of the Stamp Act crisis and the nearly simultaneous pan-Indian insurrection called Pontiac's Rebellion — as postwar developments rather than as an anticipation of the national independence that no one knew lay ahead (or even desired), Anderson re-creates the perspectives through which contemporaries saw events unfold while they tried to preserve imperial relationships.Interweaving stories of kings and imperial officers with those of Indians, traders, and the diverse colonial peoples, Anderson brings alive a chapter of our history that was shaped as much by individual choices and actions as by social, economic, and political forces.","2007-12-18","2022-05-30 10:14:45","2022-05-30 10:14:45","","","871","","","","","Crucible of War","","","","","Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FFO2clqJCqMC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=FFO2clqJCqMC","","History / Military / General; History / Modern / 18th Century; History / United States / Colonial Period (1600-1775)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A hermit on a mountain may value warm clothing and yet be hard-pressed to make it from the leaves, bark, or skins he can find. But when many people are competing with each other for satisfaction of their wants, learning how to exploit what is available becomes more difficult. In this volume, Nobel Laureate Kenneth J. Arrow analyzes why - and how - human beings organize their common lives to overcome the basic economic problem: the allocation of scarce resources. The price system is one means of organizing society to mediate competition, and Arrow analyzes its successes and failures. Alternative modes of achieving efficient allocation of resources are explored: government, the internal organization of the firm, and the 'invisible institutions' of ethical and moral principles. Professor Arrow shows how these systems create channels to make decisions, and discusses the costs of information acquisition and retrieval. He investigates the factors determining which potential decision variables are recognized as such. Finally, he argues that organizations must achieve some balance between the power of the decision makers and their obligation to those who carry out their decisions - between authority and responsibility.","1974-02-17","2022-05-30 10:17:31","2022-05-30 10:17:31","","","60","","","","","","","","","","W.

Trading among actors exhibited distinct social structural patterns that dramatically affected the direction and magnitude of option price volatility. The argument that this market is socially structured is constructed in four parts: behavioral assumptions about the nature of economic actors, models of micronetworks, models of macronetworks, and price consequences. In the ideal-typical model of the market, actors are assumed to be hyperrational and never to act opportunistically. With these behavioral assumptions, the micronetworks of actors should be expansive, a condition which would result in undifferentiated and homogeneous macronetworks. Such macronetworks would tend to reduce the volatility of option prices. But in the empirical market studied here, actors are subject to bounded rationality and some act opportunistically. Because of these behavioral constraints, actors' micronetworks are restrictive. In large markets, restrictive micronetworks generate well-differentiated macronetworks; both large size and differentiation impede communication among actors, a fact which results in exacerbated option price volatility. In Small markets,restrictive micronetworks generate less differentiated market are conductive to efficient communication which results in dampened option price volatility. The findings are discussed in relation to some major premises in microeconomic theory, and some consequent implications for public policy are presented.","1984-01","2022-05-30 10:19:50","2022-05-30 10:19:50","2022-05-30 10:19:50","775-811","","4","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A combination of analytical models and computer simulations confirm previous theoretical treatments showing that intrinsic attributes such as body size fail to account for the degree of hierarchy linearity observed in nature for typical within-group variance of such attributes. Moreover, these models explain the mathematical dynamics of the operation of winner/loser effects during hierarchy formation. Additionally, I present an analysis of these models which shows that the degree to which relationships of component triads (all combinations of three individuals in a group) within a hierarchy develop sequentially can have a significant effect on linearity and is an emergent feature of prior experience effects that previously has not been examined. I explain how this feature can operate through physical and behavioral features of social groups that increase physical proximity of subgroups within a larger group, thus increasing the probability of sequential relationship development in component triads, which in turn provides the conditions for winner/loser effects to significantly increase the probability of component triad transitivity and hierarchy linearity.","2003-01-01","2022-05-30 10:25:38","2022-05-30 10:25:38","2022-05-30 10:25:38","1275-1303","","10","140","","","Models of Dominance Hierarchy Formation","","","","","","","en","","","","","brill.com","","Publisher: Brill","","","","","AGGRESSION; HIERARCHY LINEARITY; LOSER EFFECT; SOCIAL DOMINANCE; WINNER EFFECT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At that time, the strength of the state looked like a massive obstacle to change; less than a decade later, the state's dominant characteristic was no longer its overweening powerfulness, but rather its utter decrepitude. Consequently, the role of the central state in managing economies, providing social services, and maintaining infrastructure came into question. Focusing on his native Bulgaria, Venelin I. Ganev explores in fine-grained detail the weakening of the central state in post-Soviet Eastern Europe.Ganev starts with the structural characteristics of the Soviet satellites, and in particular the forms of elite agency favored in the socialist party-state. As state socialism collapsed, Ganev demonstrates, its institutional legacy presented functionaries who had become accustomed to power with a matrix of opportunities and constraints. In order to maximize their advantage under such conditions, these elites did not need a robust state apparatus—in fact, all of the incentives under postsocialism pushed them to subvert the infrastructure of governance.Throughout Preying on the State, Ganev argues that the causes of state malfunctioning go much deeper than the policy preferences of ""free marketeers"" who deliberately dismantled the state. He systematically analyzes the multiple dimensions, implications, and significance of the institutional and social processes that transformed the organizational basis of effective governance.","2007","2022-05-30 10:25:56","2022-07-04 03:49:36","","","248","","","","","Preying on the State","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=L3-7rSihuYkC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Europe / Eastern; Political Science / American Government / National; Political Science / Political Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores the effect of those pledges on the transition to first intercourse. Adolescents who pledge are much less likely to have intercourse than adolescents who do not pledge. The delay effect is substantial. On the other hand, the pledge does not work for adolescents at all ages. Second, pledging delays intercourse only in contexts where there are some, but not too many, pledgers. The pledge works because it is embedded in an identity movement. Consequently, the pledge identity is meaningful only in contexts where it is at least partially nonnormative. Consequences of pledging are explored for those who break their promise.

Comprising a handful of formerly independent city-states and numerous smaller communities in the plains and mountains, the Florentine 'empire' in Tuscany supplied the markets and fiscal coffers of the Renaissance republic, while providing lessons in statecraft that nourished the political thought of Machiavelli and Guicciardini. This volume comprises seventeen original essays representing the new directions being taken by historians of the Florentine Renaissance.

He argues that it is far from clear that a military revolution did occur during this period. Indeed there is more evidence to suggest that the description could be applied more accurately to the following hundred years. This book also re-examines the relationship between military strength and domestic stability. Rather than seeing the latter as the consequence of the former, Dr Black argues that it makes more sense to see the former as a result of the latter.","1991-11-11","2022-05-30 10:34:35","2022-05-30 10:34:35","","","121","","","","","A Military Revolution?","","","","","Macmillan International Higher Education","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: uDZdDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=uDZdDwAAQBAJ","","History / General; History / World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A consequential related problem is to estimate the size of important subpopulations. A random sample of a population is asked whether they know anyone in a given subpopulation of size e, thus yielding an estimate of the probability that this occurs in the population. Using an equal likelihood probability model, this leads to a lower bound estimate for c, the average number of people a person in the population knows. When the number of people a person knows has a binomial distribution over the population this value is an estimate for c itself. Here we test this method on data from Mexico City, where a large random sample of people was asked whether they knew anyone in each of several different subpopulations in Mexico City of known and unknown sizes. We develop procedures for obtaining various bounds and estimates for c and determine some of the respondents' attributes on which variation in probability of knowing someone in a subpopulation and variation in personal network size seem to depend. We apply these to the estimation of e for rape victims in Mexico City and the estimation of c from data on AIDS victims in the United States.","1991-06-01","2022-05-30 10:32:53","2022-07-04 03:38:29","2022-05-30 10:32:53","109-121","","2","20","","Social Science Research","Estimating the size of an average personal network and of an event subpopulation","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is only one of the remarkable concepts explored by Gary Becker in his landmark work on the family. Becker applies economic theory to the most sensitive and fateful personal decisions, such as choosing a spouse or having children. He uses the basic economic assumptions of maximizing behavior, stable preferences, arid equilibria in explicit or implicit markets to analyze the allocation of time to child care as well as to careers, to marriage and divorce in polygynous as well as monogamous societies, to the increase and decrease of wealth from one generation to another.The consideration of the family from this perspective has profound theoretical and practical implications. For example, Becker's analysis of assortative mating can be used to study matching processes generally. Becker extends the powerful tools of economic analysis to problems once considered the province of the sociologist, the anthropologist, and the historian. The obligation of these scholars to take account of his work thus constitutes an important step in the unification of the social sciences.A Treatise on the Family will have an impact on public policy as well. Becker shows that social welfare programs have significant effects on the allocation of resources within families. For example, social security taxes tend to reduce the amount of resources children give to their aged parents. The implications of these findings are obvious and far-reaching.With the publication of this extraordinary book, the family moves to the forefront of the research agenda in the social sciences.","1991","2022-05-30 10:30:34","2022-07-04 03:28:34","","","444","","","","","A Treatise on the Family","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: NLB1Ty75DOIC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NLB1Ty75DOIC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Religion / Christian Living / Family & Relationships; Social Science / Sociology / Marriage & Family","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We tested predictions derived from maternal transmission and independent learning hypotheses by examining the extent to which variation in the degree of kin bias displayed by individual infants was related to variation in mother–infant interaction and aspects of the infant's social environment. High levels of kin bias in infants were related independently to high levels of both proximity to the mother and to potential social risk. At 25–30 weeks of age, infants displayed degrees of kin bias that were moderately correlated with those of their mothers. However, infants that spent large amounts of time near the mother did not necessarily develop degrees of kin bias that were highly similar to those of their mothers. The extent to which infants developed degrees of kin bias similar to their mothers was significantly correlated with the degree to which they experienced similar levels of social risk. The results suggest that, while intense mother–infant interaction contributes to the development of high degrees of kin bias in infants, the perpetuation of similar degrees of kin bias across generations may depend on mothers and infants having similar experiences with mutual kin and nonkin. We suggest that the perpetuation of kin bias across generations may be viewed as socially biased independent learning (Galef 1995, Animal Behaviour, 49, 1325–1334).","1999-10-01","2022-05-30 10:30:07","2022-07-04 03:31:21","2022-05-30 10:30:07","883-894","","4","58","","Animal Behaviour","Development of kin bias among rhesus monkeys","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pierre Bourdieu, a distinguished French anthropologist, develops a theory of practice which is simultaneously a critique of the methods and postures of social science and a general account of how human action should be understood. With his central concept of the habitus, the principle which negotiates between objective structures and practices, Bourdieu is able to transcend the dichotomies which have shaped theoretical thinking about the social world. The author draws on his fieldwork in Kabylia (Algeria) to illustrate his theoretical propositions. With detailed study of matrimonial strategies and the role of rite and myth, he analyses the dialectical process of the 'incorporation of structures' and the objectification of habitus, whereby social formations tend to reproduce themselves. A rigorous consistent materialist approach lays the foundations for a theory of symbolic capital and, through analysis of the different modes of domination, a theory of symbolic power.","1977-06-02","2022-05-30 10:41:06","2022-07-01 04:59:32","","","260","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: WvhSEMrNWHAC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=WvhSEMrNWHAC","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Social Science / Anthropology / General; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, I treat both frameworks as implementing in innovative ways the concept of ‘duality’, the co-constitution of elements at one level and relations at another (higher or lower) level of social action. I show that there is a remarkable homology, at the level of their formal practices, between the mathematical techniques of Bourdieu and those of Coleman. New ways to implement Galois lattice analysis are among the gains of this inquiry. Applications are to relations among the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.

The authors devise both a permutation test and an exact statistical test that separates these two aspects of regular equivalence, 0-blocks and regular-blocks. To test for the regular-block property, the natural test statistic is the number of rows and columns within each purported regular-block that fail to meet the criteria of having at least one positive entry. This statistic is computed for permutations that fix each regular-block as a whole (alternatively, within each sub-row), except for diagonal blocks, for which the diagonal entries are individually fixed. The exact test is derived by assuming that the number of zeros in each block is fixed and that each permutation of zeros is uniformly distributed. This implies that the probability of finding, say, k zeros in a given set of rows and columns follows the hypergeometric distribution, known in physics as the Fermi–Dirac statistics. These results from the separate blocks are combined by convolution to give the distribution of k zero vectors in the matrix as a whole. These tests were applied to data sets from Sampson’s Monastery, Wasserman and Faust’s Countries Trade Networks, Krackhardt’s High-Tech Managers, and B.J. Cole’s Dominance Hierarchies in Leptothorax ants. In all four cases, the 0-blocks were very significant, having only a tiny fraction of permutations with fewer errors than was found in the data. With the regular-blocks, however, there was no significant relation in the Countries data and a significant overall tendency in the other three data sets toward having more departures from regular 1-blocks in the data than in the permuted matrices.","2001-05-01","2022-05-30 10:44:20","2022-07-04 03:32:11","2022-05-30 10:44:20","87-123","","2","23","","Social Networks","Are social equivalences ever regular?","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Exact tests; Fermi–Dirac statistics; Permutation tests; Regular equivalence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, if the original equivalence was chosen to be regular in the first place, this method is invalid. Now suppose we have an algorithm (regular equivalence) for approximating the best regular equivalence for network data. If we then apply regular equivalence to a large number of random permutations of the data, we now have a valid test for the regularity of the data, relative to the regular equivalence algorithm. This approach eliminates very slow algorithms, such as simulated annealing, since the algorithm must be applied to hundreds of permuted data matrices. On the other hand, simple greedy algorithms are notorious for finding inferior local optima. Instead, we use a variable-depth search algorithm pioneered by Kernighan and Lin, and generalized by Fiduccia and Matheyses. Using this method, regularity was found not to be present in the data examined.","2002-10-01","2022-05-30 10:44:17","2022-07-04 03:32:17","2022-05-30 10:44:17","315-331","","4","24","","Social Networks","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Clustering; Regular; Significance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mathematical characterization of the conditions under which groups become relevant for the study of kinship is given and is related to the theory of structural balance. It is argued that the concept of group extension and its specialization to direct and semidirect products determine the evolutionary sequences and the coding of these kinship systems. These predictions are found to be consistent with certain observed changes, geographical distribution, and habits of usage of the kinship systems under consideration.

Sociological Insights of Great Thinkers: Sociology through Literature, Philosophy, and Science captures and examines those insights in 32 essays that discuss scholars and writers not normally associated with any sociological school of thought.Following a tradition of enriching the sociological toolkit by finding influence in philosophy and literature, the volume's contributors—an international group of renowned scholars—eschew biography to focus solely on sociological interpretations that can be drawn from the work of many of history's preeminent thinkers. Among the book's subjects are philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, Kant, and Cassirer; scientists such as Darwin and Galileo; and authors such as Kafka, Proust, and Shakespeare. The essays not only allow readers to see such thinkers in a new light, but underscore the fact that sociological questions have lain at the very heart of humanity throughout history.32 short essays discuss sociological insights of scholars and writers who are not normally associated with any sociological school of thoughtThe organization of the work allows the reader to explore the broader ideas of sociology while moving towards insightful and current sociological debatesContributors are leading sociologists from Europe and the United States, representing all streams of the discipline","2010-11-18","2022-05-30 10:44:33","2022-05-30 10:44:33","","","381","","","","","Sociological Insights of Great Thinkers","","","","","ABC-CLIO","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wl7kMHAgjq0C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=wl7kMHAgjq0C","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Philosophy / Social","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A model of Polopa feasting is first developed, taking symmetrical partnerships as its elements. It is next transformed into a model of their warfare, with similar schismogenetic properties. Feasting and warfare are then synthesised in a single model, the underlying principle of which is unity in opposition. `We' would divide against ourselves without opposition from `them', whether in feasting or warfare, and relationships of symmetrical opposition are constantly forming, reforming and transforming. The statistical evidence, though covering too short a period for proper testing, provides good descriptive support.

I need only mention the laws or bills of Lucius Philippus, Saturninus, Sextus Titius and the younger Drusus, the settlement of the Sullan veterans, the proposals of Plotius, Rullus and Flavius, the agitation of Catiline, and the land allotments of Caesar, the Triumvirs and of Augustus himself. Modern accounts tend to obscure or even deny the unity of this theme throughout the period. It is true that in the earlier phase reformers were more concerned to find remedies for social distress as such, and in the later to provide homes for veterans. But the Gracchan settlers and the veterans had two things in common: they were mostly countrymen, and they desired to obtain a secure livelihood by owning their own land. According to Appian (BC 1, 27), whose testimony we have no right to reject, the work done by the Gracchi was not lasting (cf. n. 1). Hence, the distress they had tried to alleviate persisted or revived; the governing class remained indifferent. Unorganized and unarmed, the followers of the Gracchi could save neither their leaders nor their own interests; men of the same class, with arms in their hands, were the essential instruments for bringing down the Republic.","1962-11","2022-05-30 10:47:34","2022-07-04 03:35:44","2022-05-30 10:47:34","69-86","","1-2","52","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most organizations do not know how to effectively analyze this informal structure in ways that can have a positive impact on organizational performance. Networks in the Knowledge Economy is a collection of readings on the application of social network analysis to managerial concerns. Social network analysis (SNA), a set of analytic tools that can be used to map networks of relationships, allows one to conduct very powerful assessments of information sharing within a network with relatively little effort. This approach makes the invisible web of relationships between people visible, helping managers make informed decisions for improving both their own and their group's performance. Networks in the Knowledge Economy is specifically concerned with networks inside of organizations and addresses three critical areas in the study of social networks: Social Networks as Important Individual and Organizational Assets, Social Network Implications for Knowledge Creation and Sharing, and Managerial Implications of Social Networks in Organizations. Professionals and students alike will find this book especially valuable, as it provides readings on the application of social network analysis that reflect managerial concerns.","2003-07-17","2022-05-30 10:50:13","2022-05-30 10:50:13","","","372","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: hT6P7IcWVSIC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=hT6P7IcWVSIC","","Business & Economics / General; Business & Economics / Information Management; Business & Economics / Management; Computers / Networking / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They're much better at imagining best-case scenarios (I could win the lottery!) than worst-case scenarios (A hurricane could destroy my neighborhood!). This is true not just of their approach to imagining the future, but of their memories as well: people are better able to describe the best moments of their lives than they are the worst. Though there are psychological reasons for this phenomenon, Karen A.Cerulo, in Never Saw It Coming, considers instead the role of society in fostering this attitude. What kinds of communities develop this pattern of thought, which do not, and what does that say about human ability to evaluate possible outcomes of decisions and events? Cerulo takes readers to diverse realms of experience, including intimate family relationships, key transitions in our lives, the places we work and play, and the boardrooms of organizations and bureaucracies.&nbsp;Using interviews, surveys, artistic and fictional accounts, media reports, historical data, and official records, she illuminates one of the most common, yet least studied, of human traits—a blatant disregard for worst-case scenarios. Never Saw It Coming, therefore, will be crucial to anyone who wants to understand human attempts to picture or plan the future. “In Never Saw It Coming, Karen Cerulo argues that in American society there is a ‘positive symmetry,’ a tendency to focus on and exaggerate the best, the winner, the most optimistic outcome and outlook. Thus, the conceptions of the worst are underdeveloped and elided. Naturally, as she masterfully outlines, there are dramatic consequences to this characterological inability to imagine and prepare for the worst, as the failure to heed memos leading up to both the 9/11 and NASA Challenger disasters, for instance, so painfully reminded us.”--Robin Wagner-Pacifici, Swarthmore College “Katrina, 9/11, and the War in Iraq—all demonstrate the costliness of failing to anticipate worst-case scenarios. Never Saw It Coming explains why it is so hard to do so: adaptive behavior hard-wired into human cognition is complemented and reinforced by cultural practices, which are in turn institutionalized in the rules and structures of formal organizations. But Karen Cerulo doesn’t just diagnose the problem; she uses case studies of settings in which people effectively anticipate and deal with potential disaster to describe structural solutions to the chronic dilemmas she describes so well. Never Saw It Coming is a powerful contribution to the emerging fields of cognitive and moral sociology.”--Paul DiMaggio, Princeton University","2008-09-15","2022-05-30 10:53:32","2022-05-30 10:53:32","2022-05-30 10:53:32","","","","","","","Never Saw It Coming","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.7208/9780226100296 Publication Title: Never Saw It Coming","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\YCSP8Y28\Cerulo - 2008 - Never Saw It Coming Cultural Challenges to Envisi.pdf","","","politics; pessimism; imagination; history; nonfiction; 9/11; challenger explosion; cognition; community; consequences; decision making; disaster preparedness; forecasting; future; iraq; katrina; moral sociology; nasa; optimism; outcomes; positive symmetry; prediction; preparation; psychology; results; terrorism; war on terror; warnings; worst-case scenarios","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Females are invariably antagonistic toward members of other groups, and collaborate with their own groupmates in defending territorial boundaries. Females are primarily responsible for these aggressive intergroup encounters, which occur every other day on average. Encounters are often immediately followed by intense grooming among adult females, which gives the impression of reinforcing the collaborative team. In some lower-density populations, intergroup aggression is rare; in these populations, and at Kakamega as well, female groupmates may provide other or additional services, such as protection against predators or aggressive males. Friendships among females of a single group are differentiated. Individuals interact with certain grooming and proximity partners much more than others. Despite low rates of agonism, blue monkey females also show stable if shallow dominance relationships, and linear hierarchies. Rank is not correlated with diet, feeding behavior or reproductive rate. Coalition formation is rare, and these females do not groom up the hierarchy. Grooming may simply be traded for itself, leading to highly symmetrical grooming bouts. Blue monkeys have been misclassified in theoretical papers on socioecology. Their behavior seems not to fit these models well, because certain features of their social system, related to within-group contest competition, do not co-occur as expected. Their hierarchical dominance relationships are also surprising, because rank seems to be uncorrelated with fitness-related variables. Finally, the rarity of affiliative behavior exhibited by these monkeys suggests that new ways of measuring friendships may be appropriate. The possible importance of, and reasons for, rare within-group coalitions are discussed.","2002","2022-05-30 11:10:55","2022-05-30 11:10:55","2022-05-30 11:10:55","291-314","","2/3","139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Brill","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\SKVDUNEJ\Cords - 2002 - Friendship among Adult Female Blue Monkeys (Cercop.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DNA samples were collected noninvasively from shed hair and faeces and genotyped using 13–16 microsatellite loci characterized in humans. All 14 offspring could be assigned to fathers within the community. While there is a positive relationship between male rank and reproductive success, we demonstrate that a range of male mating strategies (possessiveness, opportunistic mating and consortships) can lead to paternity across all male ranks. Several adult females were at risk of breeding with close male relatives. Most successfully avoided close inbreeding but in one case a high-ranking male in the community mated with his mother and produced an offspring. In contrast to recent data on chimpanzees (P. t. verus) from the Taï forest, Côte d’Ivoire, no evidence of extra-group paternity was observed in our study.

Clemens recovers the social origins of interest group politics in the United States. Between 1890 and 1925, a system centered on elections and party organizations was partially transformed by increasingly prominent legislative and administrative policy-making as well as the insistent participation of non-partisan organizations.  Clemens sheds new light on how farmers, workers, and women invented strategies to circumvent the parties. Voters learned to monitor legislative processes, to hold their representatives accountable at the polls, and to institutionalize their ongoing participation in shaping policy. Closely analyzing the organizational politics in three states—California, Washington, and Wisconsin—she demonstrates how the political opportunity structure of federalism allowed regional innovations to exert leverage on national political institutions.  An authoritative statement on the changes in American politics during the Progressive Era, this book will interest political scientists, sociologists, and American historians.","1997-09-02","2022-05-30 11:07:15","2022-05-30 11:07:15","","","478","","","","","The People's Lobby","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: cv8ZsiQCjPcC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=cv8ZsiQCjPcC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They demonstrate that the party systems in these four countries have been shaped by the authority granted to different levels of government. Departing from the conventional focus on social divisions or electoral rules in determining whether a party system will consist of national or regional parties, they argue instead that national party systems emerge when economic and political power resides with the national government. Regional parties thrive when authority in a nation-state rests with provincial or state governments. The success of political parties therefore depends on which level of government voters credit for policy outcomes. National political parties win votes during periods when political and economic authority rests with the national government, and lose votes to regional and provincial parties when political or economic authority gravitates to lower levels of government. This is the first book to establish a link between federalism and the formation of national or regional party systems in a comparative context. It places contemporary party politics in the four examined countries in historical and comparative perspectives, and provides a compelling account of long-term changes in these countries. For example, the authors discover a surprising level of voting for minor parties in the United States before the 1930s. This calls into question the widespread notion that the United States has always had a two-party system. In fact, only recently has the two-party system become predominant.","2009-01-10","2022-05-30 11:07:00","2022-05-30 11:07:00","2022-05-30 11:07:00","","","","","","","The Formation of National Party Systems","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400826377 Publication Title: The Formation of National Party Systems","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\D4ZTZLWG\Chhibber 그리고 Kollman - 2009 - The Formation of National Party Systems Federalis.pdf","","","Mixed-member proportional representation; Political science; Employment; Governance; Ideology; Institution; Nation state; Party system; Political party; Politician; Politics; Tax; Decentralization; Activism; Government; Left-wing politics; Opposition Party; Party leader; Proportional representation; Right-wing politics; Voting; Amendment; Ballot; Ballot access; Bharatiya Janata Party; Bicameralism; Cambridge University Press; Canadian federalism; Central government; Chhibber; Civil service; Conservative Party (UK); Democracy; Duverger's law; Economic history of the United States; Effective number of parties; Election; Elections in Canada; Elections in the United States; Electoral district; Elite; First Party System; General election; Government of Canada; Head of government; Independent politician; Indira Gandhi; Jacksonian democracy; Jurisdiction; Legislation; Legislator; Legislature; Liberalization; Local government; Lok Sabha; Major party; Majority; Member of Congress; Minor party; Multi-party system; Nation-building; National Government (United Kingdom); National Parliament (East Timor); National Policy; Nationalization; New Democrats; Nomination; Oxford University Press; Party discipline; Plaid Cymru; Policy; Political culture; Political economy; Political history; Political spectrum; Politics of India; Politics of the United States; Populism; Prince Edward Island; Public policy; Regionalism (politics); Royal Commission; Separation of powers; Single-member district; Social credit; Sovereignty; State government; State legislature (United States); Subsidy; Tariff; Two-party system; Unemployment; University of California; Uttar Pradesh; Voting behavior; Voting system; Welfare; Welfare state; Whigs (British political party); World War I","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Historically, in both countries the number of parties in local electoral districts has been near two, but the number of national parties has fluctuated. Periods of a small number of national parties in both countries correspond to periods of centralization.

A matrix of grooming interactions was compiled from detailed field notes collected over a 6-month period, during the mating season of 1972. The group underwent fission at the beginning of the 1973 mating season. The network analyses, based on an algorithm developed by Mizoguchi and Shimura (1980), and adapted by Karl Reitz for application to social structures (Reitz 1982, 1988) are designed to detect natural hierarchically arranged clusters of individuals within a group. The resulting sociograms provide measures of the cohesiveness of a group as a whole, and show how smaller clusters of close grooming partners are grouped into larger clusters within the group based on less frequent grooming interactions. The results of the network analyses are discussed in light of behavioral and demographic observations of the group's structure over the study period, and are found to compare well with the observer's intuitive understanding of the social structure of the group as described in Chepko-Sade and Sade (1979).","1989-09-01","2022-05-30 11:06:53","2022-05-30 11:06:53","2022-05-30 11:06:52","293-314","","3","11","","Social Networks","Sociometrics of Macaca Mulatta IV","Special Issue on Non-Human Primate Networks","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These methods supplement those already available with the jigsaw puzzle approach to hierarchy formation (Chase 1980, 1982, 1985) and they examine behavioural sequences in component triads, subgroups of three individuals, making up the larger group. The first method gives a new procedure for counting various kinds of attack sequences in component triads, and the second traces how relationships evolve in triads. Used together, the procedures can help explain the development of dominance structures, and in particular, what kinds of interactions produce those that are linear or near-linear. The methods are illustrated by applying them to large flocks of Harris' sparrows, Zonotrichia quereula, having 12–17 members, during hierarchy formation. This application indicates that different behavioural mechanisms may be involved in hierarchy formation for large and small groups and that some configurations of interactions in triads are much more stable than others, namely, transitive ones are much more resistant to reversals than intransitive ones. These findings suggest that earlier and later interactions may not be independent and raise a number of interesting questions about individual-level mechanisms operating during hierarchy formation.","1987-08-01","2022-05-30 11:06:49","2022-05-30 11:06:49","2022-05-30 11:06:49","1113-1128","","4","35","","Animal Behaviour","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, the model is used to discover how aggressive interactions between pairs of individuals modify subsequent interactions with bystanders or third parties. The model indicates that four sequences of successive, aggressive acts are possible in component triads of larger groups: two ensure transitive attack relationships and two can lead to either transitive or intransitive relationships. An application of the model to 14 groups of four hens demonstrates that the two sequences guaranteeing transitivity make up 77% of all sequences. More specifically, hens attacking one group member usually go on to attack a second member, and hens receiving one attack frequently receive a second attack from a bystander. In contrast, an attacked hen rarely ‘redirects’ an attack to a bystander, and a bystander rarely attacks a group member who has just attacked another individual. The application of the jigsaw puzzle approach to aggressive sequences in other species is discussed. Data available for several primate species corroborate the findings in hens and provide support for the method as a general tool for investigating the proximate mechanisms of hierarchy formation.","1985-02-01","2022-05-30 11:06:45","2022-05-30 11:06:45","2022-05-30 11:06:45","86-100","","1","33","","Animal Behaviour","The sequential analysis of aggressive acts during hierarchy formation","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two models have been proposed, both implicitly and explicitly, in the literature to explain the process of hierarchy formation. One explanation contends that animals win their places in a hierarchy through a round robin competition, and the other states that there is a high statistical correlation between position and rank on some trait or composite of traits thought to predict dominance. It is demonstrated here that both models require stringent mathematical conditions to predict linear and near linear hierarchies and that available data indicate that these conditions are not met. Most of the data cited are from studies of dominance in chickens, but the same mathematical conditions are necessary to generate linear and near linear hierarchies by the round robin and correlational models in any species.

Competing explanatory models of warfare are presented head to head, with overlapping bodies of data offered in support of each.","1990-07-12","2022-05-30 10:55:07","2022-05-30 10:55:07","","","262","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: YxO9SxtelFQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=YxO9SxtelFQC","","Social Science / Anthropology / General; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Technology & Engineering / Military Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"7M54EXHF","book","1985","Creveld, Martin Van","Command in War","","978-0-674-14441-5","","","","Many books have been written about strategy, tactics, and great commanders. This is the first book to deal exclusively with the nature of command itself, and to trace its development over two thousand years from ancient Greece to Vietnam. It treats historically the whole variety of problems involved in commanding armies, including staff organization and administration, communications methods and technologies, weaponry, and logistics. And it analyzes the relationship between these problems and military strategy. In vivid descriptions of key battles and campaigns—among others, Napoleon at Jena, Moltke’s Königgrätz campaign, the Arab–Israeli war of 1973, and the Americans in Vietnam—Martin van Creveld focuses on the means of command and shows how those means worked in practice. He finds that technological advances such as the railroad, breech-loading rifles, the telegraph and later the radio, tanks, and helicopters all brought commanders not only new tactical possibilities but also new limitations. Although vast changes have occurred in military thinking and technology, the one constant has been an endless search for certainty—certainty about the state and intentions of the enemy’s forces; certainty about the manifold factors that together constitute the environment in which war is fought, from the weather and terrain to radioactivity and the presence of chemical warfare agents; and certainty about the state, intentions, and activities of one’s own forces. The book concludes that progress in command has usually been achieved less by employing more advanced technologies than by finding ways to transcend the limitations of existing ones.","1985","2022-05-30 11:14:01","2022-05-30 11:14:01","","","356","","","","","","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: MJ7Z4P57UI8C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=MJ7Z4P57UI8C","","Political Science / General; History / Military / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gangs have proliferated over the past ten years and pose a new set of challenges to public officials, law enforcement agencies, and urban educators. Most major cities are now confronted with serious problems derived from gang violence, drug traffic, and disruption of the public educational system. In the face of deindustrialization and deepening recession, many minority youngsters view gangs as attractive alternatives to a futile search for employment in a deteriorating urban economy. Perhaps most significant, gangs are now beginning to emerge in small and medium-sized cities.Some of the nations leading scientists and scholars have been brought together in this book to examine the contemporary contours of Americas gang problem, including Daniel J. Monti, Joan Moore, Scott Cummings, Howard Pinderhughes, Diego Vigil, Ray Hutchison, Felix Padilla, Jerome H. Skolnick, Pat Jackson, and Robert A. Destro. New material dealing with wilding gangs, migration and drug trafficking, and public educational disruption appear in this volume. Other topics covered include how gangs are organized, what social function they serve, their relation to conventional society, and the social and psychological factors that contribute to their rise. The relationship of the contemporary gang problem to past research is explored, and a rich variety of case histories and comparative analysis is presented. The book also includes a section on public policy.","1993-03-03","2022-05-30 11:15:51","2022-05-30 11:15:51","","","372","","","","","Gangs","","","","","SUNY Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: hsVgDxHwwPoC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=hsVgDxHwwPoC","","Political Science / Public Policy / General; Social Science / Criminology; Social Science / Sociology / Urban; True Crime / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

C.","","978-1-62358-005-6","","","","Hannibal was one of the greatest military commanders in history. During the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage, he led a ragtag army out of Iberia, on an epic march over the Pyrenees and Alps, and down into northern Italy. There he won three dramatic victories – at Trebia, Trasimene, and Cannae – and utterly humiliated the young Roman Republic. For the next fifteen years he continued to occupy parts of Italy, and inflicted many more stinging defeats on Roman armies, despite a chronic lack of supplies and support from Carthage.Theodore Ayrault Dodge&#39;s classic history of Hannibal was first published in 1891, as part of his “Great Captains” series. The author, an experienced military officer and historian, follows the great march of Hannibal&#39;s army, reconstructs all of his battles based on personal observation of the battlefields, and explains his lasting impact on the art of war. “Hannibal” remains unequaled as the most comprehensive and readable study of one of history&#39;s great generals. This ebook edition includes an active table of contents, reflowable text, and over 200 campaign maps, battle diagrams, and illustrations.","2012-08-04","2022-05-30 11:24:05","2022-05-30 11:24:05","","","628","","","","","Hannibal","","","","","Tales End Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: s41jwK1pSS8C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=s41jwK1pSS8C","","Biography & Autobiography / Military; History / Military / Ancient; History / Military / Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the group level, adherence to a dominance convention efficiently reduces the costs associated with conflicts, but from an individual's point of view, it is difficult to explain why a low ranking individual should accept its subordinate status. This is especially true if, as suggested by several authors, dominance not necessarily reflects differences in fighting ability but rather results from arbitrary historical asymmetries. According to this idea, rank differentiation emerges from behavioural strategies, referred to as winner and loser effects, in which winners of previous conflicts are more likely to win the current conflict, whereas the losers of previous conflicts are less likely to do so. In order to investigate whether dominance, based on such winner and loser effects, can be evolutionarily stable, we analyse a game theoretical model. The model focuses on an extreme case in which there are no differences in fighting ability between individuals at all. The only asymmetries that may arise between individuals are generated by the outcome of previous conflicts. By means of numerical analysis, we find alternative evolutionarily stable strategies, which all utilize these asymmetries for conventional conflict resolution. One class of these strategies is based on winner and loser effects, thus generating evolutionarily stable dominance relations even in the absence of differences in resource holding potential.","2003","2022-05-30 11:24:03","2022-05-30 11:24:03","2022-05-30 11:24:03","1305-1332","","10","140","","","The Evolution of Social Dominance I","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Brill","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\ZVTGXT7J\Van Doorn 등 - 2003 - The Evolution of Social Dominance I Two-Player Mo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Transitive hierarchies do not only require rank differentiation within pairs of individuals but also a higher level ordering of relations within the group. Several authors have suggested that the formation of linear hierarchies at the group level is an emergent property of individual behavioural rules, referred to as winner and loser effects. Winner and loser effects occur if winners of previous conflicts are more likely to escalate the current conflict, whereas the losers of previous conflicts are less likely to do so. According to this idea, an individual's position in a hierarchy may not necessarily reflect its fighting ability, but may rather result from arbitrary historical asymmetries, in particular the history of victories and defeats. However, if this is the case, it is difficult to explain from an evolutionary perspective why a low ranking individual should accept its subordinate status. Here we present a game theoretical model to investigate whether winner and loser effects giving rise to transitive hierarchies can evolve and under which conditions they are evolutionarily stable. The main version of the model focuses on an extreme case in which there are no intrinsic differences in fighting ability between individuals. The only asymmetries that may arise between individuals are generated by the outcome of previous conflicts. We show that, at evolutionary equilibrium, these asymmetries can be utilized for conventional conflict resolution. Several evolutionarily stable strategies are based on winner and loser effects and these strategies give rise to transitive hierarchies.","2003-01-01","2022-05-30 11:24:00","2022-07-04 03:54:22","2022-05-30 11:24:00","1333-1358","","10","140","","","The Evolution of Social Dominance II","","","","","","","en","","","","","brill.com","","Publisher: Brill","","","","","Journal; Biology; Biology & Environmental Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a graph theoretical model of such a structure and prove that a necessary and sufficient condition for its existence is the absence of seven particular triad types. Expected frequencies of the seven triad types in random graphs are deduced from elementary probability theory, and we suggest that a reasonable operational statement of Homans' theory is that in most groups, the seven key triads are less frequent than the random model would predict. A data pool of sociograms and sociomatrices from 427 groups was collected from diverse published and unpublished studies. Random samples of 30 school and 30 adult groups  were drawn from the pool and analysed. Significant majorities of both samples showed deviations from chance in the directions predicted. As a check, 60 simulated groups with truly random relationships were analysed and found to be close to the chance expectations and quite different from the real data samples.

Contemporaries understood that the first federal Congress would ""flesh out"" the Constitution, and that the first federal elections were therefore an important step in the continuing struggle to shape, influence, and control the central government. The elections also provided the states with an unusual opportunity to experiment with electoral forms. The Constitution and the Confederation Congress allowed the states wide latitude in choosing Senators and in framing their laws for the election of the first presidential Electors and Representatives. This latitude encouraged experimentation and a lively public discussion about the entire electoral process. The documents presented have been collected from a wide range of sources: state legislative journals, records of debates, compilations of state laws, executive and judicial records, and other official sources, as well as from unofficial sources such as personal letters, diaries, newspapers, pamphlets, and broadsides. The subjects include preelection public and private speculation about all aspects of the elections, the official and unofficial actions of each of the states in establishing the mechanics of the elections for presidential Electors, Representatives, and Senators; election results; and contemporary commentary. Biographical sketches of the principal candidates for office and maps of the electoral districts in each state are provided, and the historical context of the documents is sketched in introductions and editorial notes. Volume I, edited by Merrill Jensen and Robert A. Becker, was published by the University of Wisconsin Press in 1976. It contains the documents concerning the first federal elections in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, as well as the Confederation Congress's actions related to the Constitution and the elections. Volume II, published in 1984, covers the elections in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Georgia. Volume IV will cover the election of the president and vice president and the elections in North Carolina and Rhode Island.","1976","2022-05-30 11:24:10","2022-05-30 11:24:10","","","636","","","","","","","","","","Univ of Wisconsin Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: rklx9c7MJFoC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=rklx9c7MJFoC","","History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This realization has spurred new interest among social scientists in the phenomenon of authoritarianism and one of its variants, corporatism.  The sixteen previously unpublished essays in this volume provide a focus for the discussion of authoritarianism and corporatism by clarifying various concepts, and by pointing to directions for future research utilizing them. The book is organized in four parts: a theoretical introduction; discussions of authoritarianism, corporatism, and the state; comparative and case studies; and conclusions and implications. The essays discuss authoritarianism and corporatism in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.","1976-06-15","2022-05-30 11:24:09","2022-05-30 11:24:09","","","561","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: BHxRrTrLSokC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=BHxRrTrLSokC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Economy; History / Latin America / South America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Egnal asserts that throughout colonial America the struggle against Great Britain was led by an upper-class faction motivated by a vision of the rapid development of the New World. In each colony the membership of this group, which Egnal calls the expansionist faction, was shaped by self-interest, religious convictions, and national origins. According to Egnal, these individuals had long shown a commitment to American growth and had fervently supported the colonial wars against France, Spain, and Native Americans. While advancing this interpretation, Egnal explores several salient aspects of colonial society. He scrutinizes the partisan battles within the provinces and argues that they were in fact clashes between the expansionists and a second long-lived faction that he calls the ""nonexpansionists."" Through close analysis he shows how economic crisis—the depression of the 1760s—influenced the colonists' behavior. And although he focuses on the initiative and leadership of the elite, Egnal also investigates the part played by the common people in the rebellion. A Mighty Empire contains insightful sketches of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and other revolutionary leaders and makes clear the human dimensions of the clash with Great Britain. The final chapter provides a new context for understanding the writing of the Constitution and considers the links between the Revolution and modern America. An appendix lists members of the colonial factions and identifies their patterns of political commitment. Now back in print with a new preface, A Mighty Empire is a valuable addition to the debate over the role of ideas and interests in shaping the Revolution. For the 2010 edition, Egnal reviews how interpretations of the American Revolution have developed since the publication of his landmark volume. In his new preface he considers and critiques explanations for the Revolution founded on ideology, the role of non-elite Americans, and British politics. Egnal also looks to a trend in the writing of the history of the Revolution that considers its effects more than its causes and thereby grapple with the conflicts ingredient in the nascent American empire. With great lucidity, he shows where the writing of history has gone since the appearance of A Mighty Empire and makes a case for its continuing relevance.","2018-10-18","2022-05-30 11:35:16","2022-05-30 11:35:16","2022-05-30 11:35:16","","","","","","","A Mighty Empire","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.7591/9781501723865 Publication Title: A Mighty Empire","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\BWXSDNMG\Egnal - 2018 - A Mighty Empire The Origins of the American Revol.pdf","","","U.S. History; Biography & Autobiography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Four views of causality—system, statistical (predictive), mechanism and algorithmic—are briefly contrasted and then examined with structural balance theory in mind. The conventional statement of the theory turns out to be under specified and inattentive to alternative mechanisms that can generate signed networks through time.

It is argued that social positions are evidenced in the interactions among individuals, which are encoded in measured social relations. Given a set of measured relations the task is to reveal social positions which consist of groups of individuals wth similar patterns of relations. Methods based on two alternative approaches are discussed. The first set of approaches is based on structural equivalence, and locates groups of similar individuals based on the extent to which they share identical ties with identical others. A second set of approaches, here called general equivalences, locates groups of similar individuals based on their sharing of “types” of ties with “types” of others. Procedures based on these different approaches are described and applied to actual data and to a constructed example. Results suggest that these different approaches identify different kinds of social groups. It is argued that structural equivalence is an unsuitable basis for analysis of relational data if the goal is detection of social positions.","1988-12-01","2022-05-30 11:42:29","2022-05-30 11:42:29","2022-05-30 11:42:29","313-341","","4","10","","Social Networks","Comparison of methods for positional analysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The disaster, the explosion of a downtown office building, occurred during a workday. The news spread rapidly, largely through communication between people who normally interacted on workdays; thus, tracing these communications provides a useful probe into work-related interaction patterns. It was found that occupational status was the best predictor of how, when, and where the news was heard. People in the formal work world tended to communicate with other workers, especially those of similar status. Moreover, as workers' status increased, so too did the number and ""quality"" of contacts, while reliance on the media declined. Housewives were the group most reliant on the media and family contacts. Students were found to interact primarily with peers and family members and appeared to be more similar to workers than housewives in terms of their linkage structures. /// On s'est servi de données établies à partir d'une information diffusée à la suite d'un désastre pour examiner la structure des rapports entre individus vivant en milieu urbain.

On a pu établir que le statut relié à une profession donnée était le meilleur prophète pour savoir comment, où et quand les nouvelles seraient entendues. Les gens qui se trouvent dans le monde ordinaire du travail ont tendance à communiquer avec d'autres travailleurs, spécialement avec ceux qui jouissent d'un rang semblable. En outre, plus le statut d'un employé augmente, plus le nombre et la qualité des contacts augmentent aussi, tandis que la confiance dans la presse (écrite et parlée) diminue. Les maîtresses de maison appartiennent au groupe qui se fie le plus à cette presse et aux contacts familiaux.

Every child was paired with every other child of the group and was thus observed playing with nine different partners. For control purposes some of the combinations were repeated with changed play material. After each session an estimate was made by two observers as to which child of the pair was the dominant one. The child who was considered dominant, was the one who, in his play, carried through what he himself wanted, and also had the other child do what he, that is, the first child-wanted, in other words he controlled both his own play and that of his companion. In doubtful cases the decision was reached by determining how frequently during a session each child controlled the other and was himself controlled. Usually the impression of the observers was confirmed by this analysis.

The topic of the conversation is classical Greek democracy and its contemporary relevance. The nineteen contributors remain diverse in their political commitments and in their analytic approaches, but all have engaged deeply with Greek texts, with normative and historical concerns, and with each others' arguments. The issues and tensions examined here are basic to both history and political theory: revolution versus stability, freedom and equality, law and popular sovereignty, cultural ideals and social practice. While the authors are sharply critical of many aspects of Athenian society, culture, and government, they are united by a conviction that classical Athenian democracy has once again become a centrally important subject for political debate. The contributors are Benjamin R. Barber, Alan Boegehold, Paul Cartledge, Susan Guettel Cole, W. Robert Connor, Carol Dougherty, J. Peter Euben, Mogens H. Hansen, Victor D.

Instead of ambush, skirmish, or combat between individual heroes, the Greeks of the fifth century B.C. devised a ferocious, brief, and destructive head-on clash between armed men of all ages. In this bold, original study, Victor Davis Hanson shows how this brutal enterprise was dedicated to the same outcome as consensual government—an unequivocal, instant resolution to dispute. Linking this new style of fighting to the rise of constitutional government, Hanson raises new issues and questions old assumptions about the history of war. A new preface addresses recent scholarship on Greek warfare.","2009-04","2022-05-31 10:46:17","2022-05-31 10:46:17","","","313","","","","","The Western Way of War","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Ec4kDQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=Ec4kDQAAQBAJ","","History / Military / General; History / Ancient / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Offering riveting battle narratives and a balanced perspective that avoids simple triumphalism, Carnage and Culture demonstrates how armies cannot be separated from the cultures that produce them and explains why an army produced by a free culture will always have the advantage.","2007-12-18","2022-05-31 10:46:15","2022-05-31 10:46:15","","","546","","","","","Carnage and Culture","","","","","Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=XGr16-CxpH8C","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Military / General; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hassig describes the role of war in the everyday life of the capital, Tenochtitlan: the place of the military in Aztec society; the education and training of young warriors; the organization of the army; the use of weapons and armor; and the nature of combat.","1988","2022-05-31 10:46:08","2022-05-31 10:46:08","","","428","","","","","Aztec Warfare","","","","","University of Oklahoma Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7M1o9g8MARgC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=7M1o9g8MARgC","","History / General; History / World; History / Latin America / Mexico; History / Military / General; History / Native American","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gangs, Crime and the Underclass in a Rustbelt City","","978-0-941702-21-8","","","","Minority gangs of the 1980s are examined as groups of juveniles and young adults and as a fraction of the forming underclass. Gangs today no longer disappear as their ethnic groups rises socially. Instead, gangs are becoming institutionalized in the central cities. This discussion of prior research in Los Angeles (California) and more recent studies in Milwaukee (Wisconsin) demonstrates that gangs are quite different than they were in the past. Underclass in this discussion refers to people permanently excluded from participation in mainstream occupations who survive through a combination of economic resources that can include welfare and profits from crime. In neither of the Chicano communities studied in Los Angeles or Milwaukee have the gangs become involved in an organized  crime infrastructure. Instead, a fraction of each gang clique moves into the underclass as the gang becomes an institutionalized feature of some poverty communities and plays a role in the perpetuation of the underclass. In both cities gangs have also become support groups in correctional settings. Interviews with 47 gang members from 19 of Milwaukee's gangs form the basis of this exploration. Five appendixes present the study questionnaire and four tables of gang data. (Contains 3 figures, 6 tables, 4 appendix tables, and 144 references.)

Distinctions are also drawn between (1) reciprocity as a pattern of mutually contingent exchange of gratifications, (2) the existential or folk belief in reciprocity, and (3) the generalized moral norm of reciprocity. Reciprocity as a moral norm is analyzed; it is hypothesized that it is one of the universal ""principal components"" of moral codes. As Westermarck states, ""To requite a benefit, or to be grateful to him who bestows it, is probably everywhere, at least under certain circumstances, regarded as a duty.

A transaction can take place only if the players involved have a connection. If the connection is direct the two players split the surplus equally, while if it is indirect then intermediate players also get an equal share of the surplus. Thus, individuals form links with others to create surplus, to gain intermediation rents, and to circumvent others who are trying to become intermediary. Our analysis clarifies the interplay between these forces in the process of strategic network formation. First, we show that, in the absence of capacity constraints on links, it leads to the emergence of a star network where a single agent acts as an intermediary for all transactions and enjoys significantly higher payoffs. Second, we study the implications of capacity constraints in the ability of agents to form links. In this case, distances between players must be long, which induces players who are “far off” to connect in order to avoid paying large intermediation rents. A cycle network then emerges, payoffs being equal across all players.","2007-11-01","2022-05-31 10:36:35","2022-05-31 10:36:35","2022-05-31 10:36:35","460-492","","1","137","","Journal of Economic Theory","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Intermediation; Network formation; Networks; Structural holes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The procedure is illustrated by elaboration of the macro implications of one aspect of small-scale interaction: the strength of dyadic ties. It is argued that the degree of overlap of two individuals' friendship networks varies directly with the strength of their tie to one another. The impact of this principle on diffusion of influence and information, mobility opportunity, and community organization is explored. Stress is laid on the cohesive power of weak ties. Most network models deal, implicitly, with strong ties, thus confining their applicability to small, well-defined groups. Emphasis on weak ties lends itself to discussion of relations between groups and to analysis of segments of social structure not easily defined in terms of primary groups.","1973-05","2022-05-31 10:36:33","2022-07-04 03:51:01","2022-05-31 10:36:33","1360-1380","","6","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accounting for these characteristics, clientelism is better understood as the product of the incomplete capitalistic rationalization of the Southern economy. Throughout the 19th century in Sicily, the feudo remained the basis of the economic and social structure, while in the continental South the feudal system disintegrated more quickly and widely. The resulting different models of social relationships within the Mezzogiorno, make it meaningful for our purposes to distinguish between two types of clientele, which may be termed clientela mafiosa and Neopolitan clientele. The second part of the article is concerned with the dynamics of the clientelistic system in post-1945 Southern Italy and more generally with the relationship between clientelism and political development. The transition from the clientelism of the notables to political party-directed patronage is studied both at the local level and in the context of the whole South. It is then argued that clientelism is a very poor tool for political development since it has two effects on the social structure and the political process: these effects will be called disorganic integration and exclusivism.","1973","2022-05-31 10:36:27","2022-05-31 10:36:27","2022-05-31 10:36:27","3-34","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1475-6765.1973.tb01281.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Professor Goody argues that such an approach prevents any serious discussion of the mechanisms leading to long-term changes in the cognitive processes of human cultures or any adequate explanation of the changes in 'traditional' societies that are taking place in the world around us. In this book he attempts to provide the framework for a more satisfactory explanation by relating certain broad differences in 'mentalities' to the changes in the means of communication, and specifically to the series of shifts involved in the development of writing. The argument is based upon theoretical considerations, as well as empirical evidence derived from recent fieldwork in West Africa and the study of a wide range of source material on the ancient societies of the Near East.","1977-11-24","2022-05-31 10:22:11","2022-05-31 10:22:11","","","196","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: baQtOyscXUwC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=baQtOyscXUwC","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Social Science / Anthropology / General; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ANF72SXT","book","2009","Goffman, Erving","Relations in Public","","978-1-4128-4519-9","","","","Until recently, to be in a &quot;public place&quot; meant to feel safe. That has changed, especially in cities. Urban dwellers sense the need to quickly react to gestural cues from persons in their immediate presence in order to establish their relationship to each other. Through this communication they hope to detect potential danger before it is too late for self-defense or flight. The ability to read accurately the &quot;informing signs&quot; by which strangers indicate their relationship to one another in public or semi-public places without speaking, has become as important as understanding the official written and spoken language of the country. In Relations in Public, Erving Goff man provides a grammar of the unspoken language used in public places. He shows that the way strangers relate in public is part of a design by which friends and acquaintances manage their relationship in the presence of bystanders. He argues that, taken together, this forms part of a new domain of inquiry into the rules for co-mingling, or public order. Most people give little thought to how elaborate and complex our everyday behavior in public actually is. For example, we adhere to the rules of pedestrian traffic on a busy thoroughfare, accept the usual ways of acting in a crowded elevator or subway car, grasp the delicate nuances of conversational behavior, and respond to the rich vocabulary of body gestures. We behave differently at weddings, at meals, in crowds, in couples, and when alone. Such everyday behavior, though generally below the level of awareness, embodies unspoken codes of social understandings necessary for the orderly conduct of society.","2009-12-31","2022-05-31 10:18:54","2022-05-31 10:18:54","","","426","","","","","","","","","","Transaction Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ApSW54vTsYwC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=ApSW54vTsYwC","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Psychology / Social Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adrian Goldsworthy explores the influence of the Roman army's organization on its behaviour during a campaign, emphasizing its great flexibility in comparison to most of its opponents. He considers the factors determining the result of a conflict and proposes, contrary to orthodox opinion, that the Roman army was able to adapt successfully to any type of warfare. Following the technique pioneered by John Keegan in The Face of Battle (1976), Dr Goldsworthy builds up a precise picture of what happened during battle: tactics employed, weaponry, leadership, behaviour of individuals as well as groups of soldiers, and, of utmost importance, morale.","1998","2022-05-31 10:18:52","2022-05-31 10:18:52","","","340","","","","","The Roman Army at War","","","","","Clarendon Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=55KE-nNtTRUC","","History / Military / Wars & Conflicts (Other); History / Ancient / Rome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Through a Window she continues the story, painting a more complete and vivid portrait of our closest relatives.   On the shores of Lake Tanganyika, Gombe is a community where the principal residents are chimpanzees. Through Goodall’s eyes we watch young Figan’s relentless rise to power and old Mike’s crushing defeat. We learn how one mother rears her children to succeed and another dooms hers to failure. We witness horrifying murders, touching moments of affection, joyous births, and wrenching deaths.   As Goodall compellingly tells the story of this intimately intertwined community, we are shown human emotions stripped to their essence. In the mirror of chimpanzee life, we see ourselves reflected.   “A humbling and exalting book . . .

Robert Freeland examines the changes in General Motors organization between the years 1924 and 1970. He takes issue with the argument of business historian Alfred Chandler and economist Oliver Wiliamson, who contend that GM's multidivisional structure emerged and survived because it was more efficient than alternative forms of organization. The book illustrates that for most of its history, GM intentionally violated the fundamental axioms of efficient organization put forth by these analysts. Moreover, it was top management that advocated these changes. Owners vehemently opposed them, touching off a struggle over corporate organization inside GM that lasted for decades. Freeland uses the GM case to re-examine existing theories of corporate governance.","2001","2022-05-31 10:14:25","2022-05-31 10:14:25","","","392","","","","","The Struggle for Control of the Modern Corporation","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: uj6te3wYm_0C","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=uj6te3wYm_0C","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Business & Economics / Economic Conditions; Political Science / Political Economy; Business & Economics / Industries / Automobile Industry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This essay then undertakes a re-evaluation of joking relationship theory with materials from a social milieu comparable to the one for wich it was originally formulated.

Such foundations are important because social differentiation makes coordination and agreement especially hard to achieve and maintain. Noah Friedkin examines the process of social influence and how this process, when it is played out in a network of interpersonal influence, may result in interpersonal agreements among actors who are located in different parts of a complexly differentiated organization. This work builds on structural role analysis, which provides a description of the pattern of social differentiation in a population. Interpreting the revealed social structures has long been problematic for structural analysis; Friedkin proposes new steps to deal with this limitation. To explain the coordination of social positions, the author seeks to develop a structural social psychology that attends to both social structure and process.

While some sociologists see these as groups ideologically committed to traditional gender relations, often exploitative, and highly controlling of female members, others have seen them as pro-female in ideology and organization, and argue that even their emphasis on a traditional feminine role is liberatory. A comparative study of 35 communes from a national sampling frame demonstrates that both sides are right. Compared to other communes, these groups are both traditionalistic in gender ideology, and they tend to empower women. Indeed, these two factors are inseparable: these groups empower women because of their emphasis on traditional femininity and because of the domination of an extremely powerful male leader and the system of control over interpersonal relations he oversees. We find two routes to gender equality--one via norms of gender egalitarianism, and one via rules enforced by a charismatic (male) leader that prevents men from snow-balling initial status advantages they might have into generalized dominance. This has general implications for what constellations of leadership are likely to empower women.","2003","2022-05-31 10:13:28","2022-05-31 10:13:28","2022-05-31 10:13:28","354-369","","4","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [Religious Research Association, Inc., Springer]","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\364L3B83\Fuller 그리고 Martin - 2003 - Women's Status in Eastern NRMs.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Subsequently, however, it had virtually no impact on mathematical thinking. It was not until 1979 that the topic was revisited and treated more thoroughly.

The theory of dissonance is here applied to the problem of why partial reward, delay of reward , and effort expenditure during training result in increased resistance to extinction.  The author contends that a state of impasse exists within learning theory largely because some of its major assumptions stand in apparent opposition to cetain well-established experimental results. The book puts forward a new theory that seems to reconcile these data and assumptions. This new theory can account for data with which other theories have difficulty: it integrates empirical phenomena that have been regarded as unrelated, and it is supported by the results of experiments designed specifically to test its implications. These experiments are fully described in the text.","1957","2022-05-31 10:02:57","2022-05-31 10:02:57","","","308","","","","","","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=voeQ-8CASacC","","Psychology / Cognitive Psychology & Cognition; Psychology / Social Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Claude Fischer presents the first social history of this vital but little-studied technology—how we encountered, tested, and ultimately embraced it with enthusiasm. Using telephone ads, oral histories, telephone industry correspondence, and statistical data, Fischer's work is a colorful exploration of how, when, and why Americans started communicating in this radically new manner.Studying three California communities, Fischer uncovers how the telephone became integrated into the private worlds and community activities of average Americans in the first decades of this century. Women were especially avid in their use, a phenomenon which the industry first vigorously discouraged and then later wholeheartedly promoted. Again and again Fischer finds that the telephone supported a wide-ranging network of social relations and played a crucial role in community life, especially for women, from organizing children's relationships and church activities to alleviating the loneliness and boredom of rural life.Deftly written and meticulously researched, America Calling adds an important new chapter to the social history of our nation and illuminates a fundamental aspect of cultural modernism that is integral to contemporary life.","1994-03-22","2022-05-31 10:02:49","2022-05-31 10:02:49","","","444","","","","","America Calling","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=0yE-CP4SmlYC","","History / United States / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"DNIYHS7D","book","2004","Fischer, David Hackett","Washington's Crossing","","978-0-19-972660-8","","","","Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia. Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, George Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. On Christmas night, as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined. Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning.","2004-02-12","2022-05-31 10:02:47","2022-05-31 10:02:47","","","577","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: AeXQCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=AeXQCwAAQBAJ","","History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800); History / Military / General; Biography & Autobiography / Military","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensive study of these political groups, in Moscow and several provincial cities, has led M. Steven Fish to conclude that they were shaped to a far greater degree by the nature of the Soviet state than by socioeconomic modernization, political culture, native psychology, or Russian historical tradition. Fish's statist theory of societal change in Russia yields a powerful explanation of why Russia's new political society differs radically not only from the ""totalized,"" sub-jugated country of the pre-1985 period but also from the ""civil societies"" found in the West and in many developing countries. In addition, the author shows how the legacy of the Soviet experience continues to influence the development--arguably the underdevelopment--of representative political institutions in post-Soviet Russia, making the establishment of stable democracy unlikely in the near term. This book proposes a novel and theoretically sophisticated way to study Russian politics. It offers a rigorous approach to understanding social movements, political party formation, regime change, and democratization in general. While focusing primarily on a single country, it is vigorously comparative at the same time.","1996-07-22","2022-05-31 10:02:45","2022-05-31 10:02:45","2022-05-31 10:02:45","","","","","","","Democracy from Scratch","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400821549 Publication Title: Democracy from Scratch","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\YSBHPY82\Fish - 1996 - Democracy from Scratch Opposition and Regime in t.pdf","","","Dictatorship; National security; Employment; Ideology; Institution; Party system; Political party; Politician; Politics; State (polity); State socialism; Corporatism; Decentralization; Externality; Public sphere; Soviet Union; Activism; Authoritarianism; Civil society; Communism; Democratization; Left-wing politics; Political campaign; Radicalism (historical); Radicalization; Social movement; Trade union; Voting; Legislature; Liberalization; Multi-party system; Sovereignty; 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt; Anti-communism; Anti-Soviet agitation; Apparatchik; Bolsheviks; Central Authority; Civil disobedience; Coalition government; Communist state; Consociationalism; Conspiracy theory; Constitutional Democratic Party; Demagogue; Demobilization; Democratic consolidation; Democratic Movement (France); Democratic Party of Russia; Democratic Russia; Demonstration (protest); Despotism; Dissident; Economic planning; Eduard Bernstein; Entrepreneurship; February Revolution; Guillermo O'Donnell; Hunger strike; Insurgency; Isolationism; Jehovah's Witnesses; Karl Marx; Labor unrest; Layoff; Leninism; Liberalism; Marxism–Leninism; Mass mobilization; Middle class; Mikhail Gorbachev; Motion of no confidence; Nina Andreyeva; No Campaign (UK); Nomenklatura; Peaceful coexistence; Perestroika; Persecution; Police action; Police state; Political entrepreneur; Political organization; Political repression; Power vacuum; Privatization; Proletarian internationalism; Referendum; Regime change; Representative democracy; Rule by decree; Russification; Samizdat; Secret police; Social democracy; Stalinism; State actor; Supermajority; Totalitarianism; Underground press; War of Laws","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social networks have increasingly become the focus of many social scientists as a way of analyzing these social structures. While many powerful network analytic tools have been developed and applied to a wide range of empirical phenomena, understanding the evolution of social organization still requires theories and analyses of social network evolutionary processes. Researchers from a variety of disciplines have combined their efforts in what is an indication of some very promising future research and the work represented in this volume provides a basis for a sustained analysis of the evolution of social life.","1997","2022-05-31 10:02:42","2022-05-31 10:02:42","","","272","","","","","","","","","","Psychology Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 9o3vLXNTGxsC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=9o3vLXNTGxsC","","Business & Economics / Structural Adjustment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet we still have a rudimentary understanding of how markets themselves are social constructions that require extensive institutional support. This groundbreaking work seeks to fill this gap, to make sense of modern capitalism by developing a sociological theory of market institutions. Addressing the unruly dynamism that capitalism brings with it, leading sociologist Neil Fligstein argues that the basic drift of any one market and its actors, even allowing for competition, is toward stabilization. The Architecture of Markets represents a major and timely step beyond recent, largely empirical studies that oppose the neoclassical model of perfect competition but provide sparse theory toward a coherent economic sociology. Fligstein offers this theory. With it he interprets not just globalization and the information economy, but developments more specific to American capitalism in the past two decades--among them, the 1980s merger movement. He makes new inroads into the ''theory of fields,'' which links the formation of markets and firms to the problems of stability. His political-cultural approach explains why governments remain crucial to markets and why so many national variations of capitalism endure. States help make stable markets possible by, for example, establishing the rule of law and adjudicating the class struggle. State-building and market-building go hand in hand. Fligstein shows that market actors depend mightily upon governments and the members of society for the social conditions that produce wealth. He demonstrates that systems favoring more social justice and redistribution can yield stable markets and economic growth as readily as less egalitarian systems. This book will surely join the classics on capitalism. Economists, sociologists, policymakers, and all those interested in what makes markets function as they do will read it for many years to come.","2018-06-05","2022-05-31 10:02:36","2022-05-31 10:02:36","2022-05-31 10:02:36","","","","","","","The Architecture of Markets","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9780691186269 Publication Title: The Architecture of Markets","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\N2FPMEZR\Fligstein - 2018 - The Architecture of Markets An Economic Sociology.pdf","","","Capitalism; Economic development; Globalization; Competition; Employment; Governance; Institution; Organization; Ownership; Social relation; Social structure; Sociology; Positioning (marketing); Structuring; Social movement; Economic policy; Unemployment; Welfare state; Entrepreneurship; Agency cost; Asset; Board of directors; Capital market; Capital structure; Commodity; Competition (economics); Competition law; Core business; Currency; Customer; Debt; Developed country; Diversification (finance); Diversification (marketing strategy); Economic anthropology; Economic forces; Economic growth; Economic integration; Economic interventionism; Economic Life; Economic sociology; Economics; Economist; Economy; Efficient-market hypothesis; Equity Market; Finance; Financial Performance; Fiscal policy; Industrial policy; Industrial relations; Industrial society; Industrialisation; Industry; Institutional economics; Institutional investor; Internal labor market; Job security; Keiretsu; Labor relations; Labour supply; Managerial economics; Managerialism; Market (economics); Market access; Market analysis; Market Dynamics; Market economy; Market environment; Market integration; Market maker; Market participant; Market segmentation; Market structure; Market value; Marketing; Marketing strategy; Mass market; Monetary policy; Nexus of contracts; Organizational behavior; Price mechanism; Principal–agent problem; Product market; Production function; Profit (economics); Recession; Rent-seeking; Right to property; Share price; Shareholder value; Stock market; Supply (economics); Technology; Trade barrier; Transaction cost; Transaction cost analysis; Value (economics); Vertical integration; World economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Related existing graph-theoretic theorems are reviewed and are integrated into a description of these networks. In addition, a rational choice theory of ego-centric network ties is introduced to evaluate the relevance of minimum distance networks for the small-world phenomenon. In particular, Nash equilibria derived from utility models of ego-centric network ties for rational actors are described.","2002-05-01","2022-06-01 09:55:38","2022-06-01 09:55:38","2022-06-01 09:55:38","161-182","","2","24","","Social Networks","The structural and behavioral characteristics of the smallest-world phenomenon","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Minimum distance networks; Nash equilibria; Rational choice of network ties; Small-world phenomenon","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This involves allocating each of the population of the U.S. to one of 16 categories; the membership of each population is a function of the target in the small world experiment. This is shown to be equivalent, for modeling purposes, to a Markov process with 16 states.The Markov transition probabilities are derived partly from reverse small world data and partly by guesswork, but using as few disposable parameters as possible (3). Statistics of chain lengths from various types of starter (e.g., those far from the target, those in the target's occupation, etc.) are derived, and compare favorably with observations. The possibility of incompleted chains is included by allowing a constant probability of loss at every step in the chain. Again, there is good agreement with most observations.How such a model might be validated by suitable observations is discussed; in particular, a set of experiments is described which should produce a great deal of additional information about the small world experiment.","1979-12-01","2022-06-01 10:39:03","2022-06-01 10:39:03","2022-06-01 10:39:03","477-505","","2","58","","Social Forces","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a recent and original data set that includes direct observations of economic choices made by firms, the process by which these interfirm lending and trade ties emerged and evolved in the early stages of reform is explored. Initially, information from sources external to the network dominated the formation and direction of exchange relations. Firms turned to their prior connections, took advantage of market position, and drew on bureaucratic power to develop alliances. Over time, internal influences gained importance, and managers increasingly drew on internal nontrade relations and other indicators inside the business group to identify lending and trade partners. The results demonstrate the central but changing role that social relations and environmental cues played in the creation of economic structure during China's transition. This study also contributes to an understanding of the processes of organizational adaptation to a major economic transition and interfirm alliance formation more generally. The findings reveal that firms select exchange partners of known reputation and solicit relations that reduce uncertainty, even when there is a cost involved.","2001","2022-06-01 10:38:59","2022-06-01 10:38:59","2022-06-01 10:38:59","336-360","","3","66","","","Exchange Structures in Transition","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [American Sociological Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\DXYBU3NF\Keister - 2001 - Exchange Structures in Transition Lending and Tra.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This realization has spurred new interest among social scientists in the phenomenon of authoritarianism and one of its variants, corporatism.  The sixteen previously unpublished essays in this volume provide a focus for the discussion of authoritarianism and corporatism by clarifying various concepts, and by pointing to directions for future research utilizing them. The book is organized in four parts: a theoretical introduction; discussions of authoritarianism, corporatism, and the state; comparative and case studies; and conclusions and implications. The essays discuss authoritarianism and corporatism in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.","1976-06-15","2022-06-01 10:38:46","2022-06-01 10:38:46","","","561","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: BHxRrTrLSokC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=BHxRrTrLSokC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Economy; History / Latin America / South America","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through portraits of four generals - archetypal hero Alexander the Great, anti-hero Wellington, the unheroic Ulysses S. Grant and the false heroic of Hitler - John Keegan propounds the view of heroism in warfare as inextricable linked with the political imperative of the age and place. He demonstrates how the role of the general alters with the ethos of the society that creates him and concludes that there is no place for heroism in a nuclear world. The Mask of Command is a companion volume to John Keegan's classic study of the individual soldier, The Face of Battle: together they form a masterpiece of military and human history.","2011-10-31","2022-06-01 10:38:43","2022-06-01 10:38:43","","","402","","","","","The Mask of Command","","","","","Random House","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=TTYGmy5A-zIC","","History / General; History / Military / General; Technology & Engineering / Military Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HUFGMIQG","book","1993","Kaminski, John P.","George Clinton: Yeoman Politician of the New Republic","","978-0-945612-17-9","","","","From an upstart Ulster County militia officer to Pharaoh of New York and vice president under both Jefferson and Madison, George Clinton cast a political shadow over the young republic for almost forty years. As outspoken supporter of the patriot cause, antifederalism, and later of Republican politics, he dominated the imbroglio of New York politics until his death in 1812. The first biography of this pivotal figure in over half a century, George Clinton analyzes the public career of this leader who, because of the destruction of his papers, has remained largely lost to history. In addition to exploring the complexities of Clinton's life, Kaminski clarifies the often arcane issues of Confederation politics. His mastery of detail, his broad knowledge of the period, and his sensitivity to the subtleties of politics on state and national levels enable him to redefine Clinton and his age. George Clinton describes how politics worked from county to Congress and how Clinton worked from behind the scenes to dominate New York. In a revelatory new interpretation, Kaminski describes how Clinton, the leading Antifederalist in the coutnry, allowed the New York State Convention to ratify the Constitution in pursuit of his ambition to become Washington's first vice president and ultimately, his successor. With this book Clinton is given his rightful place in American historiography alongside Patrick Henry, Alexander Hamilton, and Samuel Adams.","1993","2022-06-01 10:26:12","2022-06-01 10:26:12","","","376","","","","","George Clinton","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IhGflokDzmAC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=IhGflokDzmAC","","Biography & Autobiography / Presidents & Heads of State; History / United States / General; Biography & Autobiography / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This assemblage laid the foundation for the first national political body in the United States. The basic institutional identity of the Continental Congress never changed over its 15 year history. Nonetheless, perceived deficiencies in its structure and performance helped forge the Federal system founded in 1789. This book focuses on the origins, evolution, and demise of the Continental Congress, reinterpreting its successes and failures from the perspective of the new institutionalism. The authors analyze the behavioural record of the delegates - their votes, voting coalitions, work load, committee assignments - and conclude that norms, rules, and structures were as much to blame for the Congress&#39;s failure as the 12 represented states reluctance to support and finance it.","1994","2022-06-01 10:25:45","2022-06-01 10:25:45","","","404","","","","","Congressional Dynamics","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 82_KQwDU5eYC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=82_KQwDU5eYC","","Political Science / American Government / Legislative Branch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models are essentially defined in terms of permitted and forbidden triad types at the microlevel which imply and are implied by specific ordered clique structures at the macrolevel. Upon testing these models against a large collection of empirical sociomatrices, it was found that these models fit the data moderately well; however, not perfectly, since one or two triads forbidden by the models occur in over half of the sociomatrices at frequencies greater than or equal to chance expectation. These discrepancies have encouraged further theorizing and elaboration of the models, but there has heretofore been no macromodel put forth which fits the total data exactly. In this paper we obtain such a model, which allows hierarchy within cliques. In addition, we give an exact data-fitting macromodel for each class of group sizes as well, except for a somewhat less precise description for the class of largest sizes. In each case the general macromodel exhibits all of the permitted triads and none of the forbidden ones. Similar data from a study of Hallinan not only support the macromodel for the total data when the forbidden triads are taken individually but also when they are taken as a set, thus showing that the data actually support this particular macromodel and not another.","1985-09-01","2022-06-01 10:25:43","2022-06-01 10:25:43","2022-06-01 10:25:43","203-224","","3","7","","Social Networks","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The microphenomena of interest concern the effect of agreement or disagreement between members of the group on the friendship, respectively, nonfriendship between them and vice versa. We examine various versions of this type of microprocess and focus our attention on five which, at equilibrium, are in close structural relation to the five affect models arising in the Davis—Leinhardt set of empirical sociomatrices. Each version determines a micromodel consisting of the sets of triads which are permitted and forbidden in the group, and each of these in turn determines a macromodel of typical macrostructures of the group in which all of the permitted triads appear but none of the forbidden ones. We derive these micro- and macromodels and determine their structural relations to the five empirical affect models. One of these process models corresponds to a modification of Newcomb's “positive balance”, for which the corresponding micro- and macromodels define the “direct positive influence” model of Johnsen and McCann. Because of the structural closeness of two of these process models to the empirical affect models, we see that in groups presumed to be moderately close to social equilibrium, processes by which friendship induces agreement (or disagreement induces nonfriendship) much more nearly account for these affect structures than do processes by which agreement induces friendship (or nonfriendship induced disagreement). In fact, it appears that the empirical macrostructures for affect in social groups which arise in the Davis—Leinhardt data may be accounted for to a considerable extent by the inducement of agreement by friendship (or nonfriendship by disagreement), and this is also true for the last week's data in the second year of Newcomb's well known study of the acquaintance process. These two models appear fundamental in that both contain Heider's “balance” and Davis' “clustering” as special submodels, that sandwiched between them is Holland and Leinhardts' “transitivity” model, that the less restrictive of the two also contains Davis and Leinhardts' “ranked clusters of cliques” as a submodel, and that the more restrictive of the two, the modified “positive balance” or “direct positive influence” model, is also a submodel of Johnsen's “hierarchical cliques”. The theoretical results of this paper, together with substantive results from earlier empirical and experimental studies, are used to construct a broad description, with some detail, of how friendship structure can emerge and decline in social groups for which other persons, issues and values are important to the members.","1986-09-01","2022-06-01 10:25:41","2022-07-04 03:50:05","2022-06-01 10:25:41","257-306","","3","8","","Social Networks","Structure and process","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A Chicano community, peaceful on a warm summer night, residents socializing, children playing--and gang warfare ready to explode at any time. Ruth Horowitz takes us to the heart of this world, one characterized by opposing sets of values. On the one hand, residents believe in hard work, education, family ties, and the American dream of success. On the other hand, gang members are preoccupied with fighting to maintain their personal and family honor. Horowitz gives us an inside look at this world, showing us how the juxtaposition of two worlds--the streets and the social ladder--and two cultures, Mexican and American, constantly challenges the residents of the community. Ruth Horowitz is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Delaware.","1983","2022-06-01 10:18:17","2022-06-01 10:18:17","","","296","","","","","Honor and the American Dream","","","","","Rutgers University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4nhKBKZPzL4C","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=4nhKBKZPzL4C","","Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / American / Hispanic American Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We explore this idea with reference to lowland South America where dual organization is common. We have chosen, however, to place primary emphasis on the patterning of actual marriage networks. Our aim is to identify the invariant properties of such networks and, in the light of these findings, to reconsider the relationship between marriage network structure and other, categorical or jural features of social organization: kinship terminologies, descent principles, marriage rules, etc. As a means to this end, we develop the concept of matrimonial ""sidedness"". In doing so, we derive new results concerning dual organization and a new understanding of dravidianate systems. This analysis is based, on the one hand, on published genealogical data concerning the Makuna (Arhem 1981), the Pakaa-Nova (Vilaca 1992), the Yanomamo (Chagnon 1974), the Trio (Riviere 1969), the Parakana (Fausto 1990), the Waimiri-Artroari (Ferreira da Silva 1993), the Guahibo (Metzger 1968), the Shavante (Maybury-Lewis 1967) and the Suya (Seeger 1981), and on the other hand, on Hornborg's (1988) comparative study of 48 lowland South American societies.","1998","2022-06-01 10:18:15","2022-07-01 04:21:17","2022-06-01 10:18:15","214","","","","","","Taking Sides","","","","","","","en","","","","","halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr","","Publisher: Smithsonian Institution Press","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\XW7VXSYX\Houseman 그리고 White - 1998 - Taking Sides Marriage networks and Dravidian Kins.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has been used to explain how the feelings, attitudes and beliefs, which the social actors have towards each other, promotes the formation of stable (but not necessarily conflict free) social groups. While balance theory has a rich and long history, it has lost favor in recent times. The empirical work has taken one of two forms. Most empirical work on social balance has focused on dyads and triples, and findings have been inconsistent. The remaining studies focus on the structure of the group as a whole. Results here have been inconsistent also. One major problem is that the first line of work is based only on the source ideas of Heider while the second has been based only on the ideas of Cartwright and Harary. Some of the inconsistencies may be due to this empirical split where the two streams of ideas do not inform each other. We propose a new theoretical model for social balance in the form of an agent-based simulation model. The results we present account for several of the inconsistencies found in the literature. The model simulates distinct but interdependent social actors making positive and negative selections of each other in efforts to reach balanced cognitive states. The design variables for the simulations are group size, degree of contentiousness of a group and the mode of communicating choices regarding the existence and sign of social ties. The group level balance mechanism used by the dynamic model is based on the idea of partition balance, as proposed by Doreian and Mrvar [Soc. Netw. 18 (1996) 149]. Actor selections, over time, generate networks that partition group members into stable, balanced subsets at equilibrium or near equilibrium. The design variables have complicated impacts on the number of actor choices made to reach balance, the level of group imbalance, the number of actors with balanced images and the number of plus-sets formed.","2003-01-01","2022-06-01 10:18:10","2022-06-01 10:18:10","2022-06-01 10:18:10","17-49","","1","25","","Social Networks","Some dynamics of social balance processes","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\XBVZMHNX\Hummon 그리고 Doreian - 2003 - Some dynamics of social balance processes bringin.pdf","","","Balance theory; Structural balance; Agent-based simulation; Group dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions. When The Populist Revolt was originally published, the New York Times critic called it ""far and away the best account of populism that we have—and one not likely to be replaced."" That prophecy proved right; the book has not been replaced, and historians and critics agree that it is the definitive work on its subject. Now it is made available once more, after being out of print for some time. This is a history of the Farmers' Alliance and the People's Party, under whose banners a great crusade for farm relief was waged in the 1880's and 1890's. As important as the chronicle of the political movement itself is the detailed picture which Professor Hicks gives of the conditions which set the stage for this agrarian revolt. He describes the inequities and malpractices which beset both the new settlers of the West and the poverty-ridden whites and Negroes of the South following the Civil War. The story of Populism itself is a lively one, people with such picturesque leaders as ""Pitchfork"" Ben Tillman of South Carolina, ""Sockless"" Jerry Simpson and Mary Elizabeth Lease—the ""Patrick Henry in petticoats""—of Kansas, ""Bloody Bridles"" Waite of Colorado, Thomas E. Watson of Georgia, Dr. C. W. Macune of Texas, James B. Weaver of Iowa, and Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota. In these pages, Professor Hicks has, as Frederic L. Paxson pointed out, ""presented the case for Populism better than the Populists themselves could do it."" Henry Steele Commanger calls the book a ""thorough, scholarly, sympathetic and spirited history of the entire Populist movement.""","1931","2022-06-01 10:09:27","2022-06-01 10:09:27","","","490","","","","","The Populist Revolt","","","","","U of Minnesota Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: pwHKIrJjQawC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=pwHKIrJjQawC","","History / United States / State & Local / Midwest (IA, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, ND, NE, OH, SD, WI)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article empirically specifies the social structural conditions that strengthen localism under state formation. The historical case is the creation of Vermont during the Revolutionary War and the local factionalism it involved. Probate records are used to reconstruct credit networks that provided the relational foundation for localism and factional identities. The evidence demonstrates that network segregation between factional regions intensified over time, and was supported by strong cohesion within these regions. Local brokers who forged cohesion within factions consistently attained important political offices while mediators between opposing factions increasingly failed to obtain offices. This structural process coincided with the shift of Vermont's domestic politics into national level conflicts between Federalists and Jeffersonians. Within this escalation local and national factions crystallized around equivalent pairs of binary categorical oppositions. The evocation of national politics directly resonated with local lines of conflict, and reinforced factional identities and localism.","2003","2022-06-01 10:09:26","2022-06-01 10:09:26","2022-06-01 10:09:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","academiccommons.columbia.edu","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\C7W4KX5D\Hillmann - 2003 - Factional Politics and Credit Networks in Revoluti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis focuses upon one aspect of party development, namely, the agreement among members of Congress in their roll-call voting records. Spatial analysis (multidimensional scaling) permits a visual picture of the increased clustering of congressmen into two party blocs from 1789 to 1803, especially after the Jay Treaty debate in 1796.

From this analysis, based on 55 skeletons from the Tikal burial series, three important conclusions emerge with respect to ancient Maya demography and social organization. (1) Tikal was settled by people of moderate stature, and this remained relatively stable over several centuries. A marked reduction in male stature in Late Classic times may be indicative of a situation of nutritional stress, which may have had something to do with the collapse of Classic Maya civilization. (2) Stature differences between those buried in tombs and others at Tikal suggest that, in the last century B.C., a distinct ruling class developed at Tikal. This simple class division of rulers and commoners may have become more complex in Late Classic times. (3) There was a marked sexual dimorphism in stature between males and females at Tikal. This is probably partially genetic and partially a reflection of relatively lower status for women as opposed to men in Maya society.","1967-07","2022-06-01 10:01:11","2022-06-01 10:01:11","2022-06-01 10:01:11","316-325","","3","32","","","Stature at Tikal, Guatemala","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"VS8JPBVY","book","2000","Hechter, Michael","Containing Nationalism","","978-0-19-152286-4","","","","Nationalism has become the most prevalent source of political conflict and violence in the world. Scholarship has provided scant guidance about the prospects of containing the dark side of nationalism–its widely publicized excesses of violence, such as ethnic cleansing and genocide. Departing from the usual practice of considering only a few examples of nationalism drawn from a limited geographical and historical canvas, this book is based on fundamental theoretical ideas about the formation and solidarity of groups. Containing Nationalism offers a unified explanation of the dynamics of nationalism across the broad sweep of time and space. Among other things, it explains why nationalism is supported by specific forms of inequality between cultural groups, and why it is inclusive at some times and exclusive at others. Nationalism is the attempt of culturally-distinct peoples to attain political self-determination. Self-determination was generally afforded by traditional states, which employed a form of governance based on indirect rule. After the late 18th century, the rise of the modern state led to a new form of governance characterized by direct rule. Containing Nationalism argues that the impetus for the most common type of nationalism arises from the imposition of direct rule in culturally heterogeneous societies. Direct rule stimulates national identity by making cultural distinctions more salient for individuals' life chances. At the same time it reduces the resources of local elites, giving them a motive to mobilize nationalist opposition to central authorities. All told, these effects heighten the demand for sovereignty. The book suggests that political institutions that reintroduce indirect rule offer the leaders of modern countries the best available means of containing nationalist violence within their borders.","2000-02-24","2022-06-01 10:01:07","2022-06-01 10:01:07","","","274","","","","","","","","","","OUP Oxford","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=cbmPj-y8S4gC","","Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Nationalism & Patriotism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mesolevel network is a social network that differs in three important respects from interpersonal microlevel networks directly linking prior and potential adopters of a practice to one another: (1) it is generated by a different causal process than the microlevel network; (2) it tends to be much sparser than the microlevel network; and (3) the typical edge of a mesolevel network bridges much longer sociometric and geographic distances than the typical edge of a microlevel network. These types of mesolevel networks are important because they can dramatically influence the speed at which a contagious practice will diffuse. The mesolevel network focused upon in this article is the network that emerged out of the travel routes of political agitators affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. Computational modeling shows that the diffusion of the Social Democratic Party is likely to have been considerably influenced by the structure of this network. Empirical analyses of the founding of party organizations during the period 1894–1911 support these theoretical predictions and suggest that this mesolevel network was of considerable importance for the diffusion of the Swedish Social Democratic Party.","2000-07","2022-06-01 10:01:02","2022-06-01 10:01:02","2022-06-01 10:01:02","145-172","","1","106","","","Mesolevel Networks and the Diffusion of Social Movements","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adopting an unconventional analytic technique — the Galois lattice analysis — I show how network researchers can uncover relational meanings using conventional research techniques (i.e., closed-ended network surveys). Galois lattice analysis also inspires new ways of conceptualizing relational meanings in terms of the duality of persons and relationships, that is, how actors' understandings of each other as persons define the understandings of their relationships with them, and vice versa. The co-constitution of these dualistic meanings thus defines a “network culture.” Comparing two communal settings in which the meaning of “love” is constructed, I demonstrate that different network cultures produce different meaning structures that guide how actors relate to one another, resulting in different degrees of group stability.","2005-09-01","2022-06-01 09:56:17","2022-06-01 09:56:17","2022-06-01 09:56:17","391-420","","1","84","","Social Forces","What Does Love Mean?","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a brilliant and elegant exercise in model building that provides new insights into some of the old questions about philosophy of history, historical narrative, and what is called straight history.""-Hayden White, University of California, Santa Cruz  Who were the first people to inhabit North America? Does the West Bank belong to the Arabs or the Jews? Why are racists so obsessed with origins? Is a seventh cousin still a cousin? Why do some societies name their children after dead ancestors?  As Eviatar Zerubavel demonstrates in Time Maps, we cannot answer burning questions such as these without a deeper understanding of how we envision the past. In a pioneering attempt to map the structure of our collective memory, Zerubavel considers the cognitive patterns we use to organize the past in our minds and the mental strategies that help us string together unrelated events into coherent and meaningful narratives, as well as the social grammar of battles over conflicting interpretations of history. Drawing on fascinating examples that range from Hiroshima to the Holocaust, from Columbus to Lucy, and from ancient Egypt to the former Yugoslavia, Zerubavel shows how we construct historical origins; how we tie discontinuous events together into stories; how we link families and entire nations through genealogies; and how we separate distinct historical periods from one another through watersheds, such as the invention of fire or the fall of the Berlin Wall.  Most people think the Roman Empire ended in 476, even though it lasted another 977 years in Byzantium. Challenging such conventional wisdom, Time Maps will be must reading for anyone interested in how the history of our world takes shape.","2003-05-15","2022-06-01 09:56:06","2022-07-01 04:13:41","","","204","","","","","Time Maps","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: _L2TQJfRA3gC","","","https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=_L2TQJfRA3gC","","History / Social History; Social Science / General; History / General; History / Essays; Philosophy / Epistemology; Science / Time; Social Science / Human Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following in the implicit methodological footsteps of Georg Simmel, social pattern analysts view specific sociohistorical configurations as mere instantiations of such patterns, thereby deliberately disregarding various idiosyncrasies of the particular communities, events, and social situations they examine. Analytically focused, they thus draw their evidence from multiple social contexts, thereby making their essentially decontextualized findings more generalizable. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to historians and ethnographers, they try to highlight universality rather than singularity, thereby focusing their attention on the common formal features of any given pattern across those contexts while deliberately ignoring differences among its various specific manifestations. The outcome of such transcultural, transsituational, and transhistorical (that is, transcontextual) mode of inquiry is an empirically grounded “social geometry.”","2007","2022-06-01 09:56:04","2022-06-01 09:56:04","2022-06-01 09:56:04","131-145","","2","22","","","Generally Speaking","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1573-7861.2007.00010.x","","","","","comparative research; analogy; decontextualization; focus; formal sociology; genericity; Georg Simmel; social pattern analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The notion of addition of distances is developed. Different ways of adding distances result in different models of sociometric structure. Two families of models for symmetric graphs are discussed. The general model is extended to asymmetric graphs by generalizing the notion of transitivity. The model's potential for resolving a problem of the transitivity’ model is then discussed.

First, mayors are forced to give money to the members of the regional political party, and so bad circulation of politics is continued. Second, it is difficult for mayors to refuse the various claims(esp., human affairs, public discontents, claims for money, etc.) of the surrounding members of the regional political party. Third, it is possible that the disqualified persons of the regional political party will be more elected than the capable and qualified men. Fourth, the efficiency and rationality of the public administration will be more lowered and reduced.<BR> I think it is necessary, to solve these problems, the public nomination of political party of mayors should be temporarily excluded from 2002 Local Election. Because the present korean political parties can't be seen the democratic parties.","2002-03","2022-06-08 11:44:06","2022-06-08 11:44:06","2022-06-08 11:44:06","43-69","","1","14","","","","","","","","","","ko","","","","","www-dbpia-co-kr.proxy.cau.ac.kr","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\RBIH9SEN\주용학 - 2002 - 지방선거에 있어서 기초단체장의 정당공천제에 관한 연구.pdf","","","local election; local government; mayor; political party; public nomination; 기초단체장; 자치단체; 정당; 정당공천제; 지방선거","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first book of its kind, Dealing in Virtue details how an elite group of transnational lawyers constructed an autonomous legal field that has given them a central and powerful role in the global marketplace.  Building on Pierre Bourdieu's structural approach, the authors show how an informal, settlement-oriented system became formalized and litigious. Integral to this new legal field is the intense personal competition among arbitrators to gain a reputation for virtue, hoping to be selected for arbitration panels. Since arbitration fees have skyrocketed, this is a high-stakes game.  Using multiple examples, Dezalay and Garth explore how international developments can transform domestic methods for handling disputes and analyze the changing prospects for international business dispute resolution given the growing presence of such international market and regulatory institutions as the EEC, the WTO, and NAFTA.

It became evident that mother cows prefer their female and male progeny over non-related calves as grooming and as grazing partners. These associations could always be verified during the first three years and often during the fourth and fifth year as well, the descendants already being sexually fully mature. Comparable personal attachments also existing between siblings, the ensuing family units were strikingly stable and cohesive. Interindividual associations lasting for several years could also be found between non-related descendants of the herd but also between non-related cows. The analytical data led to the conclusion that in natural cattle herds the social structure is based on matriarchal families which in their turn are interconnected by means of friendship relationships between non-kin partners.","1981-01-01","2022-06-10 08:54:57","2022-06-10 08:54:57","2022-06-10 08:54:57","121-150","","3","77","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","brill.com","","Publisher: Brill","","","","","Journal; Biology; Biology & Environmental Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finding the theories of area specialists lacking, the author turned to traditional theories of party formation and change, which were created to explain these phenomena in the western setting. These theories, combined with the contextual insights provided by area specialists, provide considerable leverage on the question of party formation and change in Eastern Europe.

Theodore Porter shows that statistics was not developed by mathematicians and then applied to the sciences and social sciences. Rather, the field came into being through the efforts of social scientists, who saw a need for statistical tools in their examination of society. Pioneering statistical physicists and biologists James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann, and Francis Galton introduced statistical models to the sciences by pointing to analogies between their disciplines and the social sciences.

The major factor of productive wealth in agriculture is land, to which the peasant has little or no free access. Labor—his own, and that of his family members—is available to the peasant, but this relatively unproductive factor must be applied to land in order to generate wealth. Few other outlets for productive labor employment are available to him. When the peasant is able to combine land and labor in a wealth-generating endeavor, his productivity is likely to be extremely low, due to limiting factors such as technology, capital, marketing information, and credit. All of these life aspects combine to hold down the peasant's income and preclude savings. He is, in a word, poor.Furthermore, the peasant is powerless against many threats which abound in his environment. There are disease, accident, and death, among the natural threats. There are violence, exploitation, and injustice at the hands of the powerful, among the human threats. The peasant knows that this environmental constellation is dangerous. He also knows that there is relatively little he can do about his situation, and, accordingly, his culture often features themes of vulnerability, calamity, and misfortune. As George Foster has neatly summarized if, the outlook this situation engenders in the peasant is the “Image of the Limited Good.”","1970-06","2022-06-09 10:53:38","2022-06-09 10:53:38","2022-06-09 10:53:38","411-425","","2","64","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, recent studies suggest that male dominance is not always attractive and that it does not necessarily predict superior parental quality, better genes or other forms of benefit to females. In fact, the costs of choosing a dominant male can sometimes outweigh the benefits. When traits selected by male–male competition do not reflect overall mate quality, females are expected to use other choice cues and might occasionally prefer subordinate males.

Efficiency entails eliminating costly externalities with the least possible transaction costs (i.e. costs involved in negotiating, writing, and enforcing agreements). Our critique of efficiency shows how power relations, goal ambiguity. and the institutional relativism of choice render efficiency problematic. The sociological criterion of reproducibility may be more relevant where these features hold. If efficiency analysis is used, the sociologist should insist that it allow the identification of inefficiencies and that institutional participants welcome suggested improvements in efficiency.","1986","2022-06-09 10:47:12","2022-06-09 10:47:12","2022-06-09 10:47:12","233-253","","1","12","","","Efficiency and Social Institutions","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.so.12.080186.001313","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But in this sweeping overview of the rise of civilization, Robert O'Connell finds that war is indeed an invention--an institution that arose due to very specific historical circumstances, an institution that now verges on extinction. In Ride of the Second Horseman, O'Connell probes the distant human past to show how and why war arose. He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmental structure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it--battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistence patterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O'Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists. Around 5500 BC, these pastoralists initiated the birth of war with raids on Middle Eastern agricultural settlements. The farmers responded by ringing their villages with walls, setting off a process of further social development, intensified combat, and ultimately the rise of complex urban societies dependent upon warfare to help stabilize what amounted to highly volatile population structures, beset by frequent bouts of famine and epidemic disease. In times of overpopulation, the armies either conquered new lands or self-destructed, leaving fewer mouths to feed. In times of underpopulation, slaves were taken to provide labor. O'Connell explores the histories of the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, Egypt, Assyria, China, and the New World, showing how war came to each and how it adapted to varying circumstances. On the other hand, societies based on trade employed war much more selectively and pragmatically. Thus, Minoan Crete, long protected from marauding pastoralists, developed a wealthy mercantile society marked by unmilitaristic attitudes, equality between men and women, and a relative absence of class distinctions. In Assyria, by contrast, war came to be an end in itself, in a culture dominated by male warriors. Despite the violence in the world today, O'Connell finds reason for hope. The industrial revolution broke the old patterns of subsistence: war no longer serves the demographic purpose it once did. Fascinating and provocative, Ride of the Second Horseman offers a far-reaching tour of human history that suggests the age-old cycle of war may now be near its end.","1997-10-23","2022-06-09 10:47:08","2022-06-09 10:47:08","","","316","","","","","Ride of the Second Horseman","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: aw2MAFIhwAAC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=aw2MAFIhwAAC","","Political Science / General; Social Science / Anthropology / General; History / Military / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Stated generally, the processes of invention the authors discover there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis across multiple social networks. Specifically, political co‐optation of cambio bankers in the aftermath of the Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of domestic guild methods to the international plane, thereby changing their purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption through marriage of these elevated bankers into the victorious political alliance infused partnership with the multiplex logic (and often money) of dowry, thereby reproducing partnership systems as an integral component in post‐Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance organizational logics of marriage and clientage.

First the military practice of the West 'at home' in Europe is analysed, with special reference to the role of firearms in the transformation of both offensive and defensive warfare; to the rapid growth in army size; and to the creation of ocean-going warships which fought with long-range guns instead of ramming and boarding. He then argues that these major changes amounted to a 'military revolution' which gave Westerners a decided advantage over the people of other continents: over the Amerindians in the sixteenth century, over most Indonesians in the seventeenth, and over many Indians and Africans in the eighteenth. The book concludes with a brief survey of how the industrial revolution caused a second series of military changes which allowed the West to dominate almost the entire world by 1914."" --Book Jacket.","1996-04-18","2022-06-09 10:46:48","2022-06-09 10:46:48","","","292","","","","","The Military Revolution","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: cIFiNRH3oWsC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=cIFiNRH3oWsC","","History / World; History / Military / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Believing that successful wars were fought by professionals and aristocrats, they could not understand how ragged and hungry troops of ill-assorted civilians were able to defeat one of the world's strongest professional armies.  This book is an effort to explain how and why that upset was accomplished. Alternating with scene and summary, the narrative has pace and proportion. Battles fall into campaigns, and campaigns interpret strategy. Commanders are deftly characterized, and flashes of insight illuminate victories and defeats. There emerges a picture of American soldiers as tougher and more deeply motivated fighters than the uncommitted British and German professionals. The book also demonstrates how highly prized were the rights that the revolutionists sought to confirm or establish, and serves as a reminder today that some ideas are worth risking life for.

Largely in response to AIDS, the way in which social networks channel disease has recently become the focus of a sustained modeling effort in epidemiology. The challenge has been to develop a general framework capable of representing both simple and arbitrarily complicated mixing structures, and of solving the matching problem in a non-equilibrium multi-group population. This work is reviewed here. A recent contribution from network analysis links log-linear models of contact structure to diffusion equations for transmission. This framework is described in detail, and some applications to the spread of AIDS are described.

Economists and game theorists are in the process of developing and applying an equilibrium explanation of match formation and separation based on the principle of voluntary pairing under competitive conditions. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current state of these developments. The general existence of patnership structures with the property that no one has an incentive to separate has been established. These equilibrium structures maximize aggregate ""value"" over the set of all feasible match structures in the transferable utility case. According to this pure theory of matching, competition for partners can be expected to yield equilibrium match structures that are both stable and socially efficient, at least under conditions of frictionless certainty. Search-theoretic models that take account of meeting costs and initial uncertainty about match values have been developed to explain separation behavior as a process of shopping for a ""good match."" These models suggest several possible social inefficiencies in the match formation and separation processes. Finally, labor economists have recently provided empirical evidence that supports this view of the process.","1988-01","2022-06-09 10:01:01","2022-06-09 10:01:01","2022-06-09 10:01:01","S215-S240","","","94","","","Matching","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\D4547NZ3\Mortensen - 1988 - Matching Finding a Partner for Life or Otherwise.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Eight case studies, which include the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the Vietnam War, are examined to assess four prominent features of the donor-recipient relationship: the convergence of donor and recipient aims; donor control; commitment of donor military forces; and coherence of donor policies and strategies. As an essential part of the expanding body of multidisciplinary international scholarship, this book links history and theory to policy and narrows the gap between economics, political science, and military strategy.Each chapter refines the relevant features of the observed donor-recipient relationships into a pattern for comparison with other episodes. The final chapter collects the observations, compares them, and develops a set of uniformities that suggest a prototypical, successful donor-recipient relationship, suitable for direct application as a policy paradigm or for theoretical investigation. Mott suggests that both donor and recipient governments can use military assistance as a deliberate instrument of national policy and military strategy to achieve national aims.","1999","2022-06-09 10:00:58","2022-07-01 05:09:34","","","392","","","","","Military Assistance","","","","","Greenwood Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=_e9c-IJHCksC","","Technology & Engineering / Military Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Keeping Together in Time one of the most widely read and respected historians in America pursues the possibility that coordinated rhythmic movement--and the shared feelings it evokes--has been a powerful force in holding human groups together. As he has done for historical phenomena as diverse as warfare, plague, and the pursuit of power, William McNeill brings a dazzling breadth and depth of knowledge to his study of dance and drill in human history. From the records of distant and ancient peoples to the latest findings of the life sciences, he discovers evidence that rhythmic movement has played a profound role in creating and sustaining human communities. The behavior of chimpanzees, festival village dances, the close-order drill of early modern Europe, the ecstatic dance-trances of shamans and dervishes, the goose-stepping Nazi formations, the morning exercises of factory workers in Japan--all these and many more figure in the bold picture McNeill draws. A sense of community is the key, and shared movement, whether dance or military drill, is its mainspring. McNeill focuses on the visceral and emotional sensations such movement arouses, particularly the euphoric fellow-feeling he calls ""muscular bonding."" These sensations, he suggests, endow groups with a capacity for cooperation, which in turn improves their chance of survival. A tour de force of imagination and scholarship, Keeping Together in Time reveals the muscular, rhythmic dimension of human solidarity. Its lessons will serve us well as we contemplate the future of the human community and of our various local communities. Table of Contents: Muscular Bonding Human Evolution Small Communities Religious Ceremonies Politics and War Conclusion Notes Index Reviews of this book: ""In his imaginative and provocative book...William H. McNeill develops an unconventional notion that, he observes, is 'simplicity itself.' He maintains that people who move together to the same beat tend to bond and thus that communal dance and drill alter human feelings."" --John Mueller, New York Times Book Review ""Every now and then, a slender, graceful, unassuming little volume modestly proposes a radical rethinking of human history. Such a book is Keeping Together in Time ...Important, witty, and thoroughly approachable, [it] could, perhaps, only be written by a scholar in retirement with a lifetime's interdisciplinary reading to ponder, the imagination to conceive unanswerable questions, and the courage, in this age of over-speculation, to speculate in areas where certainty is impossible.

There are the Greeks, who invented the flute-accompanied phalanx, and the Romans, who invented calling cadence while marching.

The book shows the details of Lazarsfeld’s methodological reasoning in his projects in the field of communication. The book also presents the research institutes that Lazarsfeld founded in Vienna in 1931, from Newark Center in New Jersey (1935) to Princeton Office of Radio Research in 1937, and up to the foundation of Lazarsfeld’s famous BASR at Columbia University in New York in the 1940s.

Both the association and the group show an 'even spread' of the membership criteria on which this interaction is based, whether these are highly informal or whether they produce a corporate body. Much fruitful work has been carried out with the aid of these concepts. Nevertheless, they are inadequate for those situations involving another kind of collection of people, which may be termed the 'quasi-group'. The chapter examines the properties of the action-set by studying it in operation. It shows what is meant by 'set' and how it is related to social network. A major feature of the action-set is that by contrast with the 'unbounded' network it is limited in its membership and can be used in comparative analysis and in the study of social change.","2004","2022-06-09 09:53:22","2022-06-09 09:53:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The findings confirm that support for democratic reform is at best conditional, and negative mentions of political parties vastly outnumber positive ones. Although popular knowledge about currently active political parties is limited, five main parties attract majority support. A factor analysis of opinions of the main parties indicates three underlying dimensions: a centre/reformist dimension (subdivided into those who are partially aligned with the communists and those who oppose them); a right/nationalist dimension; and a left/communist dimension. The democratic reformist dimension attracts the largest popular support, followed by the communist dimension; the nationalist dimension attracts a negligible following. None of the three dimensions has any secure socio-economic basis within the electorate, however, and the differences that exist are mainly ideological. It is argued that the reformist and communist dimensions, perhaps under different labels, will form the basis for the more stable party system that is likely to emerge in the future.","1995-01-01","2022-06-09 09:53:16","2022-07-01 04:22:55","2022-06-09 09:53:16","49-72","","1","1","","Party Politics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","Russia; cleavages; parties and party systems; social structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DJ4PHTGC","book","1993","","The Troubled Birth of Russian Democracy: Parties, Personalities, and Programs","","978-0-8179-9233-0","","","","The demise of communism in the Soviet Union could not have occurred without the activism of dissident, anticommunist leaders who created and nourished a climate in which ordinary Russians gained the courage to stand up to and defeat communist control. But with communism ousted, what new form of government and what new leaders will emerge in Russia, a society that has never known democracy? Michael McFaul, a research associate at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Arms Control, and Sergei Markov, an assistant professor at Moscow State University, interviewed anti-communist leaders and collected the documents of anticommunist parties in the months preceding and immediately following the August 1991 attempted coup d'etat. To examine the range of the political spectrum in Russia, they also talked to procommunist leaders who emerged to oppose Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, nationalist and anti-Semitic leaders of movements such as Pamyat', labor unions, Christian movements, and organizations opposed to the division of the Soviet Union. What emerges is a kaleidoscope of leaders with distinct ideas on key issues facing Russia: how to reform the economy, what role the market should play in a new economic system, how to respond to growing demands from non-Russian republics for independence, what leaders can be trusted, what Russia's relations with the West should be, and what form of government would be best for Russia. Gathered here are essays offering historical background on the parties, selected interviews with prominent members of these groups, and important party documents. Whether democracy will flourish in Russia remains in question. The parties profiled here, actively involved in the debate over Russia's future, offer readers an insider's look into contemporary Russian politics.","1993","2022-06-09 09:53:08","2022-06-09 09:53:08","","","340","","","","","The Troubled Birth of Russian Democracy","","","","","Hoover Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=0JV-QtLl3I0C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this collection, his work appears with new commentary and bridging sections that illuminate the context in which the original papers were written. Here, students of psychology and its history can learn about the creative and critical processes that McGuire sought to study: the magical experiments on attitude innoculation showing that small doses of a persuasive message can increase resistance to later larger doses; the construction of self in terms of its distinctive and atypical features; the content, structure, and processing of thought system functioning by balancing logical consistency, realistic coping, and hedonic gratification; persuasion by Socratic questioning that selectively directs attention; and the process of doing research as an exciting and infinitely rewarding activity. These papers not only provide insight into one of psychology's greatest minds, but they also tell the story of psychology's history over the past fifty years. William J.

The focus is on practices and framing (Goffman 1974); strategic actors assemble frames improvisationally to express their distinct identity.

Degree: Ph.D.DegreeYear: 1996Institute: The University of ChicagoThe dissertation aims, through an extensive study of documents--diaries, treatises, tax records, and letters seeking office, tax breaks, recommendations, and other favors--and through network analysis, at a new theory of political culture which brings together rational actor and interpretivist accounts. The focus is on practices and framing (Goffman 1974); strategic actors assemble frames improvisationally to express their distinct identity. Meanwhile, receivers of cultural signals must interpret the identity of the petitioner according to the competence of his rhetoric, his status attributes, and his position in social networks. Identity and interest thus pass through the prism of practice and daily communicative activity to get constructed, generating an aesthetics of ''networking.''The sources of Florentine practical culture are traced from art, literature and letter-writing manuals, and their inculcation through education is outlined. Changes in the meaning of honor are traced over two centuries to discern different frames for how individuals could depict the sources of their own motivations.Letters are analyzed in the aggregate to look for patterns in framing, and through multidimensional scaling, to identify which practices are routine and which exceptional, and whether different sorts of practices adhere to different sort of requests. Letter rhetoric is correlated with the relative social capital of writers and recipients. Individual letters or sets of letters are analyzed minutely for the way different practices and frames of meaning are assembled into an image of the worthiness of the supplicant. This discourse analysis identifies frame alignment processes, contextualization cues, communications of expectation, speaking for others, the inclusive and exclusive use of boundary-drawing pronouns, and other tactics to see how writers construct images of themselves, and thereby build careers and interpersonal trust.Finally, the consequences of these specific techniques of self-presentation in letters are traced out for the development of the Florentine fiscal state, the organization of markets, and the rise of the modern Western notion of the self. function show_abstract() {   $('#abstract1').hide();   $('#abstract2').show();   $('#abstract_expand').hide(); } ▼Показать полностью","1997","2022-06-09 09:52:55","2022-07-04 03:30:44","2022-06-09 09:52:55","1","","","","","","Patronage and political culture","","","","","","","en","","","","","eLibrary.ru","","","","","","","History, European; Political Science, General; Sociology, Social Structure and Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article examines the use of these frames in Renaissance patronage‐seeking letters, both quantitatively (through multidimensional scaling) and qualitatively (using discourse analytical concepts), to present an interactionist approach to the presentation of self and, in turn, to political culture. Writing strategies are only modestly, as actors write from achieved network positions and constantly aim to improve their position, maximize leverage, and build careers through letter writing. I shall tell you, therefore, first, of what means I made use in order to become an intimate and follower of Gian Galeozzo, the duke of Milan; then I shall tell you how I went about winning the good will of Ladislas, king of Naples; finally I shall recount to you what sort of conduct enabled me to preserve the favor and good will of Pope Giovanni. I think, too, you will be pleased to learn of my various and different devices, my devious and seldom‐used means, which have rarely been described. Thesse are most useful ways to deal with men in civic life; therefore listen well to me. (Alberti 1969, p. 252) I certainly agree, Lionardo, that the things Piero said all seemed to be wise and sound and full of prudense. His subtlety and considerable artistry were also clear to me…. But it seems to me that I want some other sort of thread and texture in talk on this subject…. You know the truth–how can anyone dream that mere simplicity and goodness will get him friends, or even acquaintancs not actually harmful and annoying?…. The world is amply supplied with fraudulent, false, perfidious, bold, audacious, and rapacious men. Everything in the world is profoundly unsure…. The deal with human wickedness in all its boldness, daring, and greed one must beable to remain constant, temperate, and full of inner strength. These are the qualities I would like to see actually practiced by a man whose friendship I hoped to gain and enjoy…. So there it is; I want to be instructed in this sense concerning friendship, how to obtain it, increase it, diminish it, recover it, and make it permanent.

"M3RMV6AS","book","1936","Linton, R.","The study of man: an introduction","","","","","","This book is an ""introduction"" in two respects: its broad scope and data provide a beginner student with the essentials of anthropology, and it summarizes the accomplishments and methodological inadequacies in that field. The book is not so arranged, but in reality deals with three groups of materials: (1) the first four chapters deal with human and racial origins and the significance of racial (both physical and mental) differences; (2) chapters 7-15 discuss the nature of society and the social and political systems within it; and (3) chapters 6 and 16-26 discuss the characteristic aspects of cultural composition and change. For illustrative facts the author has drawn upon his own field work on the Comanche, Marquesans and Tanala, which are included in an introductory textbook for the first time. Some of the analyses are original, such as the classification of cultural components, from the point of view of individual participation in group life, into universals, specialties and alternatives. Social and political groups are thoroughly discussed, whereas economic life, religion and art are given practically no importance. The problems of culture and cultural change are considered from the point of view of the ""schools"" of anthropology, the presence of which is regarded as a sign of the science's immaturity. The theories of the diffusionists, functionalists, etc., are impartially analyzed and their inadequacies indicated. Throughout the book, in the last few chapters particularly (on function, interests, orientations, and culture and personality), the need for a psychological approach to anthropology is emphasized.

These features have interacted with the pluralist political landscape resulting from the vertical and horizontal constitutional division of powers. In combination with the distribution of power resulting from electoral results at different levels of government, these features have severely constrained the possibilities for coordination in and across institutional arenas.","2005-06-01","2022-06-09 09:36:15","2022-06-09 09:36:15","2022-06-09 09:36:15","1671-1695","","4","83","","Social Forces","Patterns in Contingencies","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Social structure is sought, not ideal types, although the latter are relevant to interrelations among relations. From a detailed social network, patterns of global relations can be extracted, within which classes of equivalently positioned individuals are delineated. The global patterns are derived algebraically through a ‘functorial’ mapping of the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially a generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for concatenation of effects through the network. The notion of functorial mapping is of central importance in the ‘theory of categories,’ a branch of modern algebra with numerous applications to algebra, topology, logic. The paper contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying this approach.","1971-01-01","2022-06-09 09:36:08","2022-06-09 09:36:08","2022-06-09 09:36:07","49-80","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989788","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

JohnField,oneof the significant Puritanleaders of the era, was a more persuasive propagandist than Cecil, and PatrickCollinson's account of Field'scareer,thoughsketchy,effectively showsthe meritsand failingsof the Precisionists in Churchand Parliament.But Parliamentmercifully wasnot always invading the prerogative, as the articles by S.

This second volume of Michael Mann's analytical history of social power deals with power relations between the Industrial Revolution and the First World War, focusing on France, Great Britain, Hapsburg Austria, Prussia/Germany and the United States. Based on considerable empirical research, it provides original theories of the rise of nations and nationalism, of class conflict, of the modern state and of modern militarism. While not afraid to generalize, it also stresses social and historical complexity. Michael Mann sees human society as ""a patterned mess"" and attempts to provide a sociological theory appropriate to this.

Marshall, has made four field trips between 1950 and 1955 into the Kalahari Desert in South West Africa and the Bechuanaland Protectorate to find and study Bushmen who were living in their own way, and not working for white farmers or for Negroes. The last of the four expeditions, that of 1955, was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution as well as by the Peabody Museum of Harvard.Our principal study was made with the !Kung Bushmen of the Nyae Nyae region of South West Africa. The Nyae Nyae region extends about 150 miles north and south, about 100 miles east and west, and is centred approximately at Gautscha Pan, which is located at c. 19° 48′ 30″ S. and 20° 34′ 36″ E. on the map of a survey of the area by the Administration of South West Africa dated 7.11.1935. The Nyae Nyae region is separated from the farmed areas of South West Africa by a stretch of waterless, uninhabited country over 100 miles wide., LA TERMINOLOGIE DE LA PARENTÉ CHEZ LES BOSCHIMANS !KUNGLes Boschimans !Kung sont des chasseurs et des ramasseurs nomades, qui ont eu très peu de contacts avec d'autres tribus ou avec des Européens; ils vivent en petites bandes de parents consanguins et d'affins proches, qui sont, pour la plupart, isolés à l'intérieur de leurs propres territoires, sauf pour des visites plus ou moins rares par d'autres bandes. Le système !Kung de terminologie de parenté présente deux aspects: d'après l'un, les termes sont appliqués suivant la situation biologique des personnes; d'après l'autre, les personnes sont classées avec d'autres, du fait qu'elles ont les mêmes noms. Du point de vue terminologique, deux personnes quelconques ne peuvent être apparentées simultanément de plus d'une façon, bien qu'elles puissent changer leur rapport terminologique par le mariage, ou, parfois, par le changement de leurs noms. En général, les termes employés indiquent l'âge biologique relatif des personnes qui s'appliquent mutuellement des termes de parenté. Les mêmes termes sont utilisés en s'adressant à une personne et en y faisant allusion. Pour les besoins de l'analyse, on peut distinguer entre deux systèmes de terminologie de parenté: le système A s'applique à des parents consanguins et aux personnes classées avec eux, soit par suite d'un rapport entre leurs noms, soit parce qu'elles se sont mariées avec ces parents. Le système B s'applique aux affins. Il y a trois catégories de termes dans le système A, selon leur emploi entre: (1) père ou mère et enfant; (2) ‘siblings’ (enfants de mêmes père et mère), et (3) générations. Dans cette dernière catégorie, la personne plus âgée emploie invariablement une forme diminutive en s'adressant, ou en faisant allusion, à la personne plus jeune. Dans les rapports entre parent et enfant, et entre siblings, le lien biologique constitue la seule base de la classification, mais pour tous les autres parents consanguins, ainsi que pour bien d'autres personnes encore, le nom est le facteur qui peut déterminer la nature du rapport terminologique. Le principe fondamental de ce rapport est que les personnes qui partagent le même nom occupent des positions identiques dans certains secteurs du système A. Cette méthode de classification terminologique est connue sous le nom de la méthode homonyme, afin de la distinguer de la méthode des générations. Lorsque les deux méthodes sont en désaccord, la méthode homonyme prime sur l'autre. Les !Kung n'ont aucun nom de famille; les hommes et les femmes, ainsi que les pères et les enfants, n'ont jamais le même nom. On donne à un enfant le nom d'un de ses parents consanguins ou affins de la première ou de la deuxième génération ascendante. Donc, c'est la personne qui, du point de vue biologique, est la plus âgée, qui détermine le terme qui sera employé; à vrai dire, elle applique le terme à ‘ego’ (autrement dit au ‘moi’), et ego fait de même. Les !Kung font une distinction entre le fait d'avoir reçu le nom d'une autre personne et celui de porter simplement le même nom qu'une autre personne. Quelqu'un à qui l'on donne le nom d'une autre personne est enlevé de sa catégorie biologique et est classé dans la catégorie de la personne dont il porte le nom.Les personnes peuvent être classées à l'égard d'‘ ego ’ dans trois catégories nominatives: père ou mère – enfant, sibling, et la catégorie d'ego; cette dernière catégorie comprend les personnes qui sont classées par nom ou par génération avec ego. Lorsque le nom d'une personne est changé, elle est reclassée et les termes de parenté qui lui sont appliqués sont modifiés en conséquence. Un facteur important dans le rapport des noms est une liste ancestrale de noms auxquels les termes sont liés. Le système B s'applique aux affins. Dès qu'une personne entre dans un des rapports affinaux primaires avec ego, ego abandonne le terme qu'il employait précédemment et adopte le terme qui est lié au rapport affinal, même si cette personne porte le même nom que lui. Les rapports affinaux primaires comprennent les épouses de siblings, l'épouse d'ego, le père et la mère et les siblings de l'épouse d'ego, etc. Les rapports affinaux secondaires comprennent les pères et mères, les enfants et les siblings d'affins primaires, qui ne sont pas, eux-mêmes, des affins primaires. Le mariage avec un parent consanguin, ou avec une personne qui porte le nom de son propre père ou mère, est défendu. Le mariage est contracté de préférence avec une personne qui est apparentée du fait qu'elle porte le même nom, mais qui n'est pas consanguine. Les rapports sexuels ne sont autorisés qu'avec son conjoint. La parenté à plaisanterie est importante et divise les parents consanguins, les affins et les personnes qui sont apparentées du fait qu'elles portent le même nom, en deux groupes. Un individu peut plaisanter, ou non, avec chaque personne à laquelle il applique un terme de parenté et le rapport est toujours réciproque. Les plaisanteries sont ordinairement de nature sexuelle ou injurieuse, mais on montre de la modération et du respect envers les personnes plus âgées. Le rapport, du fait de porter le même nom, constitue un facteur important dans le raffermissement social, car les !Kung appliquent un terme de parenté à chaque !Kung qu'ils rencontrent et les rapports, du fait de porter le même nom, s'étendent sur une région très large.","1957-01","2022-06-09 09:35:07","2022-06-09 09:35:07","2022-06-09 09:35:07","1-25","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A coherent linkage between these two forms of explanation, however, requires the introduction of undemonstrable but nonaxiomatic claims, which undermines the coherence of the Theory.

In particular, both Max Weber and Michelle Foucault point to the unique nature of societal rationalization in the early modern period, a thorough-going upheaval both in forms of social organization and in individual subjectivity. These correlative changes led to the nature of the modern state and its citizens. One example used by both is the rationalization of warfare. Close attention to the question of rationalization and the history of infantry warfare, however, suggests that far from representing a watershed change from non-rationalized to rationalized war, the early-modern period was more like other rapid expansions of armies based on recruitment of commoners, and had little to do with the distinctive characteristics of the emerging nation-states.","2005-06-01","2022-06-09 09:34:48","2022-06-09 09:34:48","2022-06-09 09:34:48","229-275","","3","34","","Theor Soc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\T5UAFGR7\Martin - 2005 - The objective and subjective rationalization of wa.pdf","","","Close Attention; Rapid Expansion; Social Organization; Subjective Rationalization; Western Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But other forms of vertical hierarchy may emerge in non-task groups. One form, orderings of dominance, has been studied among animals using systematic behavioral observations, but almost never among humans, despite many discussions of such structures existing among adolescent males. Using stochastic models, this paper examines change in vertical orderings for data on dominance encounters among same-sex adolescent campers. There seem to be different paths for stabilization of vertical hierarchies for boys and girls, both of which involve the emergence of special roles, the top boy or the bottom girl. Further, stabilization seems to be greatly facilitated (at least for boys) by members adopting Roger Gould's theory of dominance encounters and turning their attention to those close in rank.","2009-09-01","2022-06-09 09:34:43","2022-07-01 05:20:00","2022-06-09 09:34:43","241-264","","3","72","","Soc Psychol Q","Formation and Stabilization of Vertical Hierarchies among Adolescents","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\6JQAEPC7\Levi Martin - 2009 - Formation and Stabilization of Vertical Hierarchie.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such triadic effects retain importance even when we use alternative measures of contact, and when we control for individual-, dyadic-, and group-level effects including geographic separation.

The paper then examines four Southeast Asian polities, of different degrees of political development, with attention to the manner in which they combine group and dyadic structures. The examples are the Kalinga, a pagan ethnolinguistic group of Northern Luzon; the Tausug, a Muslim group of the Sulu archipelago; the traditional Thai monarchy; and the present Republic of the Philippines. In each case the effects of structure upon the operation of the system are explored.

The conventional perception of science in Western societies has been modified in recent years by the work of philosophers, sociologists and historians of science. In this book Bruno Latour brings together these different approaches to provide a lively and challenging analysis of science, demonstrating how social context and technical content are both essential to a proper understanding of scientific activity. Emphasizing that science can only be understood through its practice, the author examines science and technology in action: the role of scientific literature, the activities of laboratories, the institutional context of science in the modern world, and the means by which inventions and discoveries become accepted. From the study of scientific practice he develops an analysis of science as the building of networks. Throughout, Bruno Latour shows how a lively and realistic picture of science in action alters our conception of not only the natural sciences but also the social sciences and the sociology of knowledge in general.This stimulating book, drawing on a wealth of examples from a wide range of scientific activities, will interest all philosophers, sociologists and historians of science, scientists and engineers, and students of the philosophy of social science and the sociology of knowledge.","1987","2022-06-09 09:22:32","2022-06-09 09:22:32","","","292","","","","","Science in Action","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: sC4bk4DZXTQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=sC4bk4DZXTQC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, comparative historical arguments about war and state-making are combined with agency theory to answer this question. The Spring and Autumn and Warring States eras that preceded the Qin unification of China created the necessary conditions for bureaucratization by weakening the aristocracy, creating a bureaucratic model, facilitating the development of roads, and providing trained and disciplined personnel. Comparative analysis shows that the main factor differentiating Qin China from other states and empires was the extreme weakness of the aristocracy produced by an unusually long period of severe warfare. Although Qin China was more bureaucratic than any other state or empire prior to the seventeenth century, it was far from completely bureaucratic.

Revolution produces bureaucratization only when the monitoring capacity of states is developed enough to make bureaucratic organization more efficient than alternatives such as tax farming and collection by local notables. As monitoring capacity varies across types of taxes and levels of administration, states also bureaucratize at different paces and are differentially affected by revolution. This explains why the revolutions in England and France had greater effects on indirect taxes than on direct taxes and at top levels of tax administration compared to lower levels. Thus, revolution is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for bureaucratization, but it contributes to the process by sweeping away impediments to reform.","2001-07","2022-06-09 09:12:21","2022-06-09 09:12:21","2022-06-09 09:12:21","183-223","","1","107","","","Revolution and State Structure","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two questions can be posed: Do individual wars produce immediate effects on taxes, or is the cumulative effect of long periods of warfare more important? How do variations in administrative capacity and the strength of representative institutions affect the extent to which war pushes the growth of the state? This article attempts to answer these questions with a quantitative analysis of the effects of war on taxation in early modern England and France. We find that the cumulative effect of war is strong in both cases, suggesting that war made states via a “ratchet effect,” and that this effect is much stronger when the administrative capacity of states is improved by centralization and bureaucratization. Strong representative assemblies decrease the effect of war on state growth in France but increase it in England, due to the very different characteristics of these institutions in the two countries.","2001-12-01","2022-06-09 09:12:17","2022-06-09 09:12:17","2022-06-09 09:12:17","411-448","","2","80","","Social Forces","Determinants of the Growth of the State","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Prussian tax system was one of the most efficient in early modern Europe. Scholars have argued that (1) the Prussian tax administration was highly bureaucratic, and (2) its efficiency was due primarily to its bureaucratic characteristics. We challenge both propositions. We show that the Prussian tax system deviated from the bureaucratic ideal type in important respects. We then develop general propositions about the conditions under which bureaucratic forms of recruitment, monitoring, and sanctioning are more efficient than alternative forms of agency. We conclude that the efficiency of the Prussian tax collection system was caused by specific deviations from the ideal-typical bureaucracy that increased the ability of rulers to control tax officials.","1994","2022-06-09 09:12:14","2022-06-09 09:12:14","2022-06-09 09:12:14","187-204","","2","59","","","Bureaucracy and Efficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [American Sociological Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\JRAHR8ZU\Kiser 그리고 Schneider - 1994 - Bureaucracy and Efficiency An Analysis of Taxatio.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Epistemic cultures, shaped by affinity, necessity, and historical coincidence, determine how we know what we know. In this book, Karin Knorr Cetina compares two of the most important and intriguing epistemic cultures of our day, those in high energy physics and molecular biology. Her work highlights the diversity of these cultures of knowing and, in its depiction of their differences--in the meaning of the empirical, the enactment of object relations, and the fashioning of social relations--challenges the accepted view of a unified science. By many accounts, contemporary Western societies are becoming knowledge societies--which run on expert processes and expert systems epitomized by science and structured into all areas of social life. By looking at epistemic cultures in two sample cases, this book addresses pressing questions about how such expert systems and processes work, what principles inform their cognitive and procedural orientations, and whether their organization, structures, and operations can be extended to other forms of social order. The first ethnographic study to systematically compare two different scientific laboratory cultures, this book sharpens our focus on epistemic cultures as the basis of the knowledge society.","1999-05-01","2022-06-09 09:11:56","2022-06-09 09:11:56","","","380","","","","","Epistemic Cultures","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: WFEeib0Q9L0C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=WFEeib0Q9L0C","","Biography & Autobiography / Science & Technology; Philosophy / Epistemology; Science / Philosophy & Social Aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, local parties necessarily act as the primary democratic institutions that link ordinary citizens to local governmental institutions, and transitively to the national political system.

Just as Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey introduced readers to the fascinating lives of chimpanzees and gorillas, Kummer brings us face to face with the Hamadryas baboon. With their furry white mantles and gleaming red hindquarters, the Hamadryas appear frequently in the art of the ancient Egyptians--who may have interpreted the baboons' early morning grooming rituals as sun-worshiping rites. Back then, Hamadryas were thought to be incarnates of Thoth, the god of wisdom; today they are considered to have one of the most highly structured social systems among primates, very close, in some respects, to that of humans. In the 1960s, Kummer, after conflicts with nomadic warriors, managed to track down these elusive baboons near the Danakil Desert, and then followed them from dawn to dusk on their treks from one feeding place to another. His scientific account of this period reads like a travel memoir as he describes his encounters with the Hamadryas and the people with whom they share the desert. Winding his way through cliffs and stubble, Kummer records the baboons' social life, from the development of pair relationships to the way an entire group decides where to march each day. Much like the human nomads who cope with the harsh demands of the desert environment, the Hamadryas maintain a society that is strict and patriarchal in its details but multilayered and flexible in its largest units. We learn, for example, of the Hamadryas' respect for possession that protects family structure and of the cohesion among family leaders that lessens the threat of battle. At the same time, clear-cut personalities emerge from Kummer's account, drawing us into the life stories and power struggles of individual baboons. Whereas this rich detail holds many implications for natural scientists, the colorful way it comes to life makes for a compelling book bound to entertain and educate all readers.

This is more difficult with regard to the animal’s knowledge about his social companions than about extra-specific objects. While social knowledge as evident in the natural habitat is in some cases accessible to simple experiments, social intelligence requires long-term laboratory studies. The field examples reported in this paper confirm that apparently simple behavior such as “hiding” or “not fighting” may involve more knowledge about others than complex interactions like “protected threat”; parsimonious behavior may result from unparsimonious internal processes.","1982","2022-06-09 09:11:24","2022-07-04 03:56:58","","113-130","","","","","","","Life Sciences Research Reports","","","","Springer","Berlin, Heidelberg","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Dominant Male; Reciprocal Altruism; Social Intelligence; Social Knowledge; Vervet Monkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous social network studies tend to treat the characteristics of social ties through which information is acquired as causes that may affect instrumental outcomes. However, little research has directly examined the spread of information via social ties and the tie effect on information dissemination. Using telephone survey data collected after the outbreak of an extensive commercial rumor in Hong Kong, the present paper investigates the characteristics of social ties through which the information is spread and the tie effect on information dissemination. Results show that while mass media, particularly television, serves as a major channel of information flow, social ties are also widely used. Individuals tend to share information with strong ties, or people with whom they perceive to have good relations. However, information transmitted via kin ties tends to arrive at the respondent faster than via nonkin ties or other communication channels.

""Stigler's writings might well be subtitled 'The Joys of Doing Economics.' He, more than any other contemporary American economist, dispels the gloom surrounding economic theory.

I use institutional and relational/network analysis to reconsider three tacit assumptions of these debates: (1) citizenship must be defined as a status; (2) capitalist development and citizenship formation must occur together; and (3) theories of citizenship must be based on the relationship between the state and capitalism. These assumptions are examined in T. H. Marshall's ([1949] 1964) classic historical sociological work, Citizenship and Social Class. By examining Marshall's thesis in its original empirical context of eighteenth-century English history, I demonstrate that varying patterns of institutional relationships among law, communities, and political cultures were central factors in shaping modern citizenship rights. Focusing on regional variation in citizenship practices among eighteenth-century English working communities, I suggest that: (1) citizenship should be redefined as an ""instituted process"" rather than a status; (2) the development of citizenship rights depended on the nexus of England's national legal infrastructure and the varying community capacities for participatory association; and (3) future research on citizenship and democratization expand beyond a focus on states and capitalism to include a sociology of relationships among public spheres, community associational life, and patterns of political culture.","1993","2022-06-10 09:50:39","2022-06-10 09:50:39","2022-06-10 09:50:39","587-620","","5","58","","","Citizenship and the Place of the Public Sphere","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [American Sociological Association, Sage Publications, Inc.]","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\59PP3JDW\Somers - 1993 - Citizenship and the Place of the Public Sphere La.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gangs have proliferated over the past ten years and pose a new set of challenges to public officials, law enforcement agencies, and urban educators. Most major cities are now confronted with serious problems derived from gang violence, drug traffic, and disruption of the public educational system. In the face of deindustrialization and deepening recession, many minority youngsters view gangs as attractive alternatives to a futile search for employment in a deteriorating urban economy. Perhaps most significant, gangs are now beginning to emerge in small and medium-sized cities.Some of the nations leading scientists and scholars have been brought together in this book to examine the contemporary contours of Americas gang problem, including Daniel J. Monti, Joan Moore, Scott Cummings, Howard Pinderhughes, Diego Vigil, Ray Hutchison, Felix Padilla, Jerome H. Skolnick, Pat Jackson, and Robert A. Destro. New material dealing with wilding gangs, migration and drug trafficking, and public educational disruption appear in this volume. Other topics covered include how gangs are organized, what social function they serve, their relation to conventional society, and the social and psychological factors that contribute to their rise. The relationship of the contemporary gang problem to past research is explored, and a rich variety of case histories and comparative analysis is presented. The book also includes a section on public policy.","1993-03-03","2022-06-10 09:50:33","2022-06-10 09:50:33","","","372","","","","","Gangs","","","","","SUNY Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: hsVgDxHwwPoC","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=hsVgDxHwwPoC","","Political Science / Public Policy / General; Social Science / Criminology; Social Science / Sociology / Urban; True Crime / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas existing accounts tend to assume that this type of collective decision making can be understood by linking fixed interests—either material or ideological—to specific, decontextualized propositions, we argue that the meaning of any one issue was dependent upon its position relative to other issues in the overall sequence of questions. Consequently, each decision changed the meaning of future issues, and hence how actors understood where their commonalities of interest lay. Devoted to the task of rebuilding the institutions that constituted the national state, delegates explicitly reshaped the board on which the political game would be played such that patterns of action within the Convention had implications for patterns of action outside of the Convention. As each subsequent decision within the Convention fixed a previous point of contention, it also indirectly determined which issues would become viable points of conflict in the future. By the end of the Convention, even before the first presidential election, state delegations began to arrange themselves in a manner consonant with the outlines of the first party system. This previously unrecognized finding only makes sense, however, in terms of a temporally contextualized model of political action.","2007-02-01","2022-06-10 09:50:26","2022-06-10 09:50:26","2022-06-10 09:50:26","42-67","","1","72","","Am Sociol Rev","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\HY7WDHED\Slez 그리고 Martin - 2007 - Political Action and Party Formation in the United.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although three different males held alpha rank during the period, the male dominance hierarchy remained relatively stable even when the number of males was high. Average dominance rank and overall RS of males while in the group were strongly correlated. However, during most years the correlation between male dominance rank and RS was not statistically significant because males who achieved high rank 1)were those who experienced relatively high RS as lower ranking subadults and 2) maintained high dominance rank after experiencing a sustained decline in RS. Correlations between male dominance rank and RS were highest when the number of subadult males entering the dominance hierarchy was increasing and one or a very few males were least effective in monopolizing females. These results are not consistent with expectations based solely on the priority of access model of intrasexual selection. Female choice, as exemplified by the preference of females for mating with young males that are rising in rank, might also influence the evolution of social dominance in rhesus macaques.","1994-01-01","2022-06-10 09:50:13","2022-06-10 09:50:13","2022-06-10 09:50:13","225-242","","3-4","129","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","brill.com","","Publisher: Brill","","","","","Journal; Biology; Biology & Environmental Sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, some of the most sophisticated and influential observation methods for sampling vertebrate social behavior grew out of baboon studies, invented by scientists who were trying to cope with the intricacies of baboon behavior. Barbara Smuts' eloquent study of baboons reveals a new depth to their behavior and extends the theories needed to account for it.While adhering to the most scrupulous methodological strictures, the author maintains an open research strategy--respecting her subjects by approaching them with the open mind of an ethnographer and immersing herself in the complexities of baboon social life before formulating her research design, allowing her to detect and document a new level of subtlety in their behavior. At the Gilgil site, described in this book, she could stroll and sit within a few feet of her subjects. By maintaining such proximity she was able to watch and listen to intimate exchanges within the troop; she was able, in other words, to shift the baboons well along the continuum from """"subject"""" to """"informant."""" By doing so she has illuminated new networks of special relationships in baboons. This empirical contribution accompanies theoretical insights that not only help to explain many of the inconsistencies of previous studies but also provide the foundation for a whole new dimension in the study of primate behavior: analysis oft he dynamics of long-term, intimate relationships and their evolutionary significance.At every stage of research human observers have underestimated the baboon. These intelligent, curious, emotional, and long-lived creatures are capable of employing stratagems and forming relationships that are not easily detected by traditional research methods.

Reacting against the conventional wisdom, which stresses how little attention the general public pays to political issues and the lack of consistency in their political opinions, the studies presented in this book redirect attention to the processes of reasoning that can be discerned when people are confronted with choices about political issues. These studies demonstrate that ordinary people are in fact capable of reasoning dependably about political issues by the use of judgmental heuristics, even if they have only a limited knowledge of politics and of specific issues. An important point is that both the well-educated and the less-educated use heuristics in political reasoning, but that the well-educated tend to employ different heuristics and take into account more factors in their consideration of issues.","1993-07-30","2022-06-10 09:50:00","2022-06-10 09:50:00","","","328","","","","","Reasoning and Choice","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7mJw5IHI0lYC","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=7mJw5IHI0lYC","","Political Science / History & Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There, I was of necessity concerned with the monumental evidence, and did not look far beyond it. But there are historical implications which should be faced and also, I think, some further historical support for the conclusions there reached.The conclusions were briefly these. The equipment of arms and armour, which modern writers tend to group together as the ‘hoplite panoply’, was originally a motley assemblage. Certain of its components—the long iron sword and spear—were part of the equipment of most warriors of the era, and of many periods before and since. Other items resemble those used by Mycenaean warriors some five centuries earlier: these include the bronze plate-corslet, the greave and (an optional accessory) the ankle-guard. I cannot believe, with some scholars, that such advanced and costly products of the bronze-smith had been produced continuously throughout the Dark Age that followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilisation; and indeed for at least 400 years there is no evidence of any kind that they were. Rather, they were revived or readopted: the corslet apparently under the influence of the metal-working cultures of Central Europe and Italy, the greave and ankle-guard spontaneously, although the Epic tradition had never forgotten their earlier use. Other items again, the closed helmet of the type that the Greeks called Corinthian, and the large round shield with arm-band and hand-grip, were Greek variants devised as an improvement on foreign models, principally the metal open-faced helmets and round single-grip shields used by the Assyrians, Urartians and other Eastern peoples. The combination of all these elements together was an original Greek notion; as was their later association with a novel form of massed infantry tactics, the phalanx.","1965-11","2022-06-10 09:49:57","2022-06-10 09:49:57","2022-06-10 09:49:57","110-122","","","85","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It recognizes the traditional, time-honored functions of command, explains more recent developments in the process of command and control, and examines both the useful capability and the perhaps imperfectly understood limitations of modern communications and computer systems. We have all progressed from a world in which global strategies were paramount to one in which regional strategies and joint, combined, and coalitional operations have become the norm. In this new world, the military may be increasingly called upon to assume more noncombat roles and peacekeeping missions. The challenges to leadership, to command and control, grow more complex each year, as does the technology supporting the commander. But the balance between how individual commanders operate and how the C4 system itself affects their operations must be constantly readdressed and refined.

Laird.Herbert Simon's classic and influential The Sciences of the Artificial declares definitively that there can be a science not only of natural phenomena but also of what is artificial. Exploring the commonalities of artificial systems, including economic systems, the business firm, artificial intelligence, complex engineering projects, and social plans, Simon argues that designed systems are a valid field of study, and he proposes a science of design. For this third edition, originally published in 1996, Simon added new material that takes into account advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.Simon won the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1978 for his research into the decision-making process within economic organizations and the Turing Award (considered by some the computer science equivalent to the Nobel) with Allen Newell in 1975 for contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.

"42AU76VC","book","1993","Sharp, James Roger","American Politics in the Early Republic: The New Nation in Crisis","","978-0-300-06519-0","","","","During the years from 1789 to 1801, the republican political institutions forged by the American Constitution were put to the test. A new nation--born in revolution, divided over the nature of republicanism, undermined by deep-seated sectional allegiances, and mired in foreign policy entanglements--faced the challenge of creating a stable, enduring national authority and union.  In this engagingly written book, James Roger Sharp offers a penetrating new assessment disputing the conventional wisdom that the birth of the country was a relatively painless and unexceptional one. Instead, he tells the dramatic story of how the euphoria surrounding the inauguration of George Washington as the country's first president quickly soured. Soon, the Federalist defenders of the administration and their Republican critics regarded each other as bitter political enemies. The intense partisanship prevented the acceptance of the idea that an opposition could both oppose and be loyal to the government. As a result, the nation teetered on the brink of disintegration as fear, insurrection, and threats of secession abounded. Many even envisioned armed civil conflict as a possible outcome.  Despite the polarization, the nation did manage to survive its first trial. The election of Thomas Jefferson in 1801 and the nonviolent transfer of power from one political group to another ended the immediate crisis. But sectionally based politics continued to plague the nation and eventually led to the Civil War.","1993-01-01","2022-06-10 09:49:52","2022-06-10 09:49:52","","","388","","","","","American Politics in the Early Republic","","","","","Yale University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=XXhB9NDS-iIC","","History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This chapter provides an overview of the communication networks, methodology employed in the research on communication networks and considers some of the structural properties of these networks, and outlines the major findings of experimental investigations of the effects of networks on group process. The major network difference is between centralized and decentralized networks. The direction and magnitude of the effects are modified by the following variables: kind of task, noise, information distribution, member personality, reinforcement, and the kind of prior experience the members have had in networks. The variable having the most pronounced effect is the kind of task the group must perform. Centralized networks are generally more efficient when the task requires merely the collection of information in one place, and decentralized networks are more efficient when further operations must be performed on the information before the task can be completed. The experiments discussed in the chapter, presents a great deal about the effects of communication networks, but the precise nature of many of the relationships among variables still remains unclear, and needs much clarification, such as network characteristics, kind of task, and group composition. The communication network studies have provided a great deal of information regarding structural effects upon group behavior. However, much more remains to be done.","1964-01-01","2022-06-10 09:49:49","2022-06-10 09:49:49","2022-06-10 09:49:49","111-147","","","1","","","","","","","","Academic Press","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","DOI: 10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60050-7","","","","","","Berkowitz, Leonard","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They address three questions: Under what conditions will strong party organizations emerge? What influences the character of parties--in particular, their reliance on patronage? In what circumstances will the parties that formerly dominated politics in a nation or city come under attack? Shefter's work exemplifies the ""new institutionalism"" in political science, arguing that the reliance of parties on patronage is a function not so much of mass political culture as of their relationship with public bureaucracies. The book's opening chapters analyze the circumstances conducive to the emergence of strong political parties and the changing balance between parties and bureaucracies in Europe and America. The middle chapters discuss the organization and exclusion of the American working classes by machine and reform regimes. The book concludes by examining party organizations as instruments of political control in the largest American city, New York.","1993-12-27","2022-06-10 09:49:44","2022-06-10 09:49:44","2022-06-10 09:49:44","","","","","","","Political Parties and the State","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400821228 Publication Title: Political Parties and the State","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\79IYHDMJ\Shefter - 1993 - Political Parties and the State The American Hist.pdf","","","Political science; National security; Employment; Ideology; Institution; Party system; Patronage; Political machine; Political party; Political structure; Politician; Politics; Spoils system; Tax; Corporatism; Public sphere; Activism; Labour movement; Opposition Party; Party leader; Political campaign; Radicalism (historical); Regime; Right-wing politics; Trade union; Voting; Civil service; Election; Jacksonian democracy; Legislation; Legislator; Legislature; Local government; Major party; Multi-party system; Nation-building; Party discipline; Policy; Political culture; Political economy; Political history; Political spectrum; Politics of the United States; Populism; State government; Two-party system; Voting behavior; Voting system; Insurgency; Mass mobilization; Political organization; Aristocracy; Benjamin Ginsberg (political scientist); Citizens (Spanish political party); Corporatocracy; Democratic-Republican Societies; Domestic policy; Election law; Electoral college; Electoral reform; Federalist Party; Government agency; Grand coalition; Lord Randolph Churchill; Martin Van Buren; National Labor Relations Act; National Labor Union; New Deal coalition; New Politics (magazine); Parliamentary authority; Party line (politics); Political agenda; Political alliance; Political class; Political climate; Political faction; Political methodology; Political movement; Political opportunity; Political Order in Changing Societies; Political sociology; Political system; Posse Comitatus (organization); Power broker (politics); Progressivism in the United States; Reactionary; Realigning election; Reformism; Second Party System; Social revolution; State-building; States' rights; Syndicalism; The Political Machine; The Political Process; The Public Interest; Trasformismo; Voter registration; Working class; Write-in candidate","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present investigation attempts to assess the relation of general gang structure and criminal activity to the criminal behavior of individual gang members. Methods. The analyses derive from responses to surveys completed by 373 male juveniles who identified themselves as gang members prior to incarceration in mostly maximum security correctional facilities. Respondents were questioned about the organization of the gangs to which they belonged, about their gangs' involvement in carrying firearms, using drugs, selling drugs, robbery, and burglary, and about their own involvement in these same offenses. Results. Gang- and individual-level criminality generally is specialized. Gang structure is ambiguously associated with the forms of crime gangs commit but is unrelated to individual members' criminality. Types of gang-level and types of individual-level criminality are related. Conclusions. ""Gang"" thus signifies more than the nominal congregation of youth for protective and social purposes.","1995","2022-06-10 09:49:42","2022-06-10 09:49:42","2022-06-10 09:49:42","53-68","","1","76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [University of Texas Press, Wiley]","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\KJD7JN7X\Sheley 등 - 1995 - Gang Organization, Gang Criminal Activity, and Ind.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MFW5VV35","book","1999","Keen, Maurice","Medieval Warfare : A History: A History","","978-0-19-154252-7","","","","This richly illustrated book explores over seven hundred years of European warfare, from the time of Charlemagne to the end of the middle ages (c.1500). The period covered has a distinctive character in military history. It was an age when organization for war was integral to social structure, when the secular aristocrat was by necessity also a warrior, and whose culture was profoundly influenced by martial ideas. Twelve scholars, experts in their own fields, have contributed to this finely illustrated book. It is divided into two parts. Part I seeks to explore the experience of war viewed chronologically with separate chapters on, for instance, the Viking age, on the wars and expansion of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, on the Crusades and on the great Hundred Years War between England and France. The chapters in Part II trace thematically the principal developments in the art of warfare; in fortification and siege craft; in the role of armoured cavalrymen; in the employment of mercenary forces; the advent of gunpowder artillery; and of new skills in navigation and shipbuilding. In both parts of the book, the overall aim has been to offer the general reader an impression, not just of the where and the when of great confrontations, but above all of the social experience of warfare in the middle ages, and of the impact of its demands on human resources and human endurance.","1999-08-26","2022-06-10 09:20:21","2022-06-10 09:20:21","","","354","","","","","Medieval Warfare","","","","","OUP Oxford","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ME7XjYdiE1UC","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=ME7XjYdiE1UC","","History / Europe / General; History / Europe / Medieval; Technology & Engineering / Military Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through original and extensive research using farm account books, administration accounts at probate, and town tax valuations, Rothenberg makes a significant contribution to the long-standing and vigorous debate about the pace, pattern, and genesis of growth in the early American economy. Rothenberg powerfully disputes the dominant historiography of the last two decades, which describes the early New England village as a ""moral economy"" insulated from the exigencies of the market. Contrary to the prevailing view, Rothenberg shows that farmers were engaged in a variety of market relations in the late eighteenth century. Through innovative use of little used archival material, Rothenberg finds that the relevant economic magnitudes - farm commodity prices, wages for day and monthly farm labor, and the determinants of rural wealth holding - behaved as if they had been formed in a market. This ground breaking discovery reveals how an agricultural economy that lacked both an important export staple and technological change could experience market-led growth. To understand this impressive economic development, Rothenberg discusses a number of provocative questions. By what process does a proliferation of market-places become a market economy? How and when did the rural economy of New England become involved in markets for farm produce, farm labor, and rural capital? What were the consequences of the ""spread of themarket"" for agricultural labor productivity and for the industrial transformation of the region? Rothenberg's thorough investigations demonstrate that markets for farm produce, farm labor, and rural capital emerged between 1785 and 1800, at the same time that labor productivity grew dramatically. By linking market integration to labor productivity growth, Rothenberg confirms that Massachusetts agriculture and the preindustrial economy that rested upon it were transformed by a burgeoning market economy soon after the American Revolution.","1992-11-15","2022-06-10 09:20:15","2022-06-10 09:20:15","","","308","","","","","From Market-Places to a Market Economy","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TpqPM17KHf4C","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=TpqPM17KHf4C","","Business & Economics / General; Business & Economics / Economic Conditions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If inequality is intolerable - and Rousseau shows with unparalleled eloquence how it robs us not only of our material but also of our psychological independence - then how can we recover the peaceful self-sufficiency of life in the state of nature? We cannot return to a simpler time, but measuring the costs of progress may help us to imagine alternatives to the corruption and oppressive conformity of modern society. Rousseau's sweeping account of humanity's social and political development epitomizes the innovative boldness of the Enlightenment, and it is one of the most provocative and influential works of the eighteenth century. This new translation includes all Rousseau's own notes, and Patrick Coleman's Introduction builds on recent key scholarship, considering particularly the relationship between political and aesthetic thought.","1999","2022-06-10 09:20:12","2022-06-10 09:20:12","","","180","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: cEHeuy7WWx0C","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=cEHeuy7WWx0C","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The way in which the term 'social organization' is used here is a deliberate attempt to place it as an empirical subject, capable of being expressed in terms of quantitative observations. The social organization of a natural group is based on long-term relationships. The Japanese workers have found that mothers in their M. fuscata groups retain a special relation with their daughters long after their daughters mature. Eccentric population composition, and environmental stresses like lack of cover and feeding competition are fairly obvious factors in the extreme conditions of captivity that lead to unusual or unstable social organization. Only for one species, man, is the range of variability in social organization fairly well known, but it is suggested that variability of the same order might reasonably be expected in other primates.","1967","2022-06-10 09:20:06","2022-06-10 09:20:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 17","","","","","","Rowell, T.

Behaviour and reproductive cycles of females were recorded, and the behaviour repertoire of both species described, with emphasis on comparison with better known Catarrhines. A picture of social structure was built up by asking the basic question ‘who did what to whom how often’. In both groups the single adult male was not the highest ranking animal, but whereas in the Sykes, he was of more or less equal rank with the top female, in the vervets he was chased and threatened even by the lowest ranking female. It is suggested that this striking difference from, for example, baboons or macaque males might be related to female dentition differences, the female guenon, unlike the female baboon, mangabey or macaque, having long, sharp, effective canines. Male-female interactions were found to change very little, qualitatively or quantitatively, with the reproductive state of the female. Sykes' monkeys changed frequency of male-female interaction when they were mating, but the content of the interaction was unchanged except that they were seen to mate at these times. In neither species was copulation accompanied by other recognizable behaviour. Female interaction patterns changed with reproductive state rather more consistently than intersexual interactions, but differences were often small.","1971-11-01","2022-06-10 09:19:59","2022-06-10 09:19:59","2022-06-10 09:19:59","625-645","","4","19","","Animal Behaviour","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article introduces the concepts of “notification norms” and the “information order,” showing how the former constrain the behavior of nodes in social networks as well as enabling manipulation of the relationships that comprise those networks. “Notification” is defined as information transmission motivated by role obligations and notification norms as social rules that govern such transmission. These rules produce patterns of information dissemination different from what individual volition would yield and from what technology makes possible. The capacity to wield a socially sanctioned repertoire of notification rules is a learned competence. Competent notifiers must also understand the local epistemological ecology—the distribution and trajectory of information, as well as the projects, concerns, and priorities of one's fellows. This study of notification introduces the broader concept of “the information order” and is a first step in the project of a sociology of information.","2006-09-01","2022-06-10 09:19:50","2022-06-10 09:19:50","2022-06-10 09:19:50","228-254","","3","24","","Sociological Theory","Getting the Word Out","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\YTPNLCDV\Ryan - 2006 - Getting the Word Out Notes on the Social Organiza.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the latter has seldom been quantified, the ranks of individuals in the two orders are usually assumed to be correlated. This paper reports on a longitudinal study of a free-ranging group of rhesus monkeys. The individual histories of progression of dominance rank and an independently determined measure of centrality in the social grooming network are compared among a set of males. Centrality is not a static correlate of dominance rank as implied by the findings of short-term studies. Rather, centrality is a more sensitive indicator of status than is dominance rank, to which it is related in a dynamic fashion. Small changes in dominance rank may be followed by large changes in centrality. An increase in centrality may facilitate rise in dominance rank. These findings suggest a complex psychology of status, rather than a simple causative relation between the two variables.","1988","2022-06-10 09:19:41","2022-06-10 09:19:41","2022-06-10 09:19:41","409-425","","4","77","","","Sociometrics of Macaca mulatta","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ajpa.1330770403","","","","","Cayo Santiago; Life history; Status","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They explore such topics as ways to specify the network contents to be studied, how to select the method for representing network structures, how social network analysis has been used to study interorganizational relations via the resource dependence model, how to use a contact matrix for studying the spread of disease in epidemiology, and how cohesion and structural equivalence network theories relate to studying social influence. It also offers statistical models for social support networks.

"DJP3FUJC","book","2012","Savin-Williams, Richard C.","Adolescence: An Ethological Perspective","","978-1-4613-8682-7","","","","Books on adolescence have been written for a variety of purposes. Hall's (1904) two volume Adolescence encompasses most of them: to advocate a particular theoretical approach to adolescence, to stimulate use of a particular brand of scientific methodology when studying youth, to address issues of the basic nature and importance of adolescence, and to propose recommendations on how adolescents ought to be treated and educated. In Hall's words, ""It [the two volumes] constitutes the first attempt to bring together the various aspects of its vast and complex theme"" (xix), a full survey of ""pedagogic matter and method. "" This is necessary because, ""In no psychic soil, too, does seed, bad as well as good, strike such deep root, grow so rankly, or bear fruit so quickly or so surely"" (xviii-xix). Mead (1928) retorted with Coming of Age in Samoa, a refutation of Hall's conclusions: ""Are the disturbances which vex our adolescents due to the nature of adolescence itself or to the civilization? Under different conditions does adolescence present a different picture"" (p. II). Thus, Mead wanted to correct a theoretical injustice and to promote the impact that culture has on the developing adolescent personality. Hollingshead's (1949) Elmtown's Youth was produced to further support Mead's conclusions-""Is the social behavior of an adolescent a function of physiological changes in the maturing individual or of his experiences in society?"" (p. 6). His answer was clearly the latter, specifically the family's economic and social status within Elmtown's social structure.","2012-12-06","2022-06-10 09:19:17","2022-07-01 04:42:14","","","296","","","","","Adolescence","","","","","Springer Science & Business Media","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7t3JBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=7t3JBgAAQBAJ","","Psychology / General; Education / General; Medical / Pediatrics; Self-Help / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There, he learned that these majestic animals, far from being the aggressive apes of film and fiction, form close-knit societies of caring mothers and protective fathers watching over playful young. Alongside his observations of gorilla society, Schaller celebrates the enforced yet splendid solitude of the naturalist, recounts the adventures he experienced along the way, and offers a warning against poaching and other human threats against these endangered creatures. This edition features a postscript detailing Schaller’s more recent visits with gorillas, current to 2009.  “Whether the author is tracking gorillas, slipping past elephant herds on narrow jungle paths, avoiding poachers’ deadfalls, or routing Watusi invaders, this is an exciting book.

Inasmuch as patron-client structures are not unique to Southeast Asia but are much in evidence, particularly in Latin America, in Africa, and in less developed portions of Europe, the analysis may possibly have more general value for understanding politics in preindustrial societies. After defining the nature of patron-client ties and distinguishing them from other social ties, the paper discriminates among patron-client ties to establish the most important dimensions of variation, examines both the survival and transformations in patron-client links in Southeast Asia since colonialism and the impact of major social changes such as the growth of markets, the expanded role of the state, and the creation of local regimes. Finally, the paper shows how patron-client bonds interact with electoral politics to create distributive pressures which, in turn, often lead to inflationary fiscal policies and vulnerability of regimes to losses of revenue.","1972-03","2022-06-10 09:18:56","2022-06-10 09:18:56","2022-06-10 09:18:56","91-113","","1","66","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\6INWTBCL\Scott - 1972 - Patron-Client Politics and Political Change in Sou.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"AMENZCBA","book","1995","Shapin, Steven","A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England","","978-0-226-75019-4","","","","How do we come to trust our knowledge of the world? What are the means by which we distinguish true from false accounts? Why do we credit one observational statement over another?  In A Social History of Truth, Shapin engages these universal questions through an elegant recreation of a crucial period in the history of early modern science: the social world of gentlemen-philosophers in seventeenth-century England. Steven Shapin paints a vivid picture of the relations between gentlemanly culture and scientific practice. He argues that problems of credibility in science were practically solved through the codes and conventions of genteel conduct: trust, civility, honor, and integrity. These codes formed, and arguably still form, an important basis for securing reliable knowledge about the natural world.  Shapin uses detailed historical narrative to argue about the establishment of factual knowledge both in science and in everyday practice. Accounts of the mores and manners of gentlemen-philosophers are used to illustrate Shapin's broad claim that trust is imperative for constituting every kind of knowledge. Knowledge-making is always a collective enterprise: people have to know whom to trust in order to know something about the natural world.","1995-11-15","2022-06-10 09:18:54","2022-06-10 09:18:54","","","516","","","","","A Social History of Truth","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Cr4lEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=Cr4lEAAAQBAJ","","Social Science / General; History / General; Science / General; Science / History; Social Science / Popular Culture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first demonstrates that people who hold a status belief can “teach” it by treating the other in accord with the belief. The second shows that third‐party participants who witness such behavioral treatments also acquire the status belief. The first experiment also verifies a general mechanism by which interaction creates status beliefs: nominally different participants developed shared status beliefs about the difference from the repeated enactment of influence hierarchies corresponding to the difference. This general mechanism suggests that any structural condition that gives one group a systematic advantage in gaining influence over another group in intergroup encounters will foster the development of widely shared status beliefs favoring the advantaged group.","2000-11","2022-06-10 09:18:52","2022-06-10 09:18:52","2022-06-10 09:18:52","579-615","","3","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While Tocquevillian theories have concentrated mostly on the connection between civic associationism and democracy, this article develops a Gramscian approach, suggesting that a strong associational sphere can facilitate the development of authoritarian parties and hegemonic authoritarian regimes. Two countries are used for comparison, Italy from 1870 to 1926 and Spain from 1876 to 1926. The argument here is that the strength of the associational sphere in north-central Italy provided organizational resources to the fascist movement and then party. In turn, the formation of the party was a key reason why the Italian regime developed as a hegemonic authoritarian regime. The absence of a strong associational sphere in Spain explains why that regime developed as an economic corporate dictatorship, despite many similarities between the two cases.","2005-04-01","2022-06-10 09:18:49","2022-06-10 09:18:49","2022-06-10 09:18:49","288-310","","2","70","","Am Sociol Rev","Civic Associations and Authoritarian Regimes in Interwar Europe","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\M8Q9QZBG\Riley - 2005 - Civic Associations and Authoritarian Regimes in In.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Riordan “Nobody thinks of drawin’ the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft.” This classic work offers the unblushing, unvarnished wit and wisdom of one of the most fascinating figures ever to play the American political game and win. George Washington Plunkitt rose from impoverished beginnings to become ward boss of the Fifteenth Assembly District in New York, a key player in the powerhouse political team of Tammany Hall, and, not incidentally, a millionaire. In a series of utterly frank talks given at his headquarters (Graziano’s bootblack stand outside the New York County Court House), he revealed to a sharp-eared and sympathetic reporter named William L. Riordan the secrets of political success as practiced and perfected by him and fellow Tammany Hall titans. The result is not only a volume that reveals more about our political system than does a shelfful of civics textbooks, but also an irresistible portrait of a man who would feel happily at home playing ball with today’s lobbyists and king makers, trading votes for political and financial favors. Doing for twentieth-century America what Machiavelli did for Renaissance Italy, and as entertaining as it is instructive, Plunkitt of Tammany Hall is essential reading for those who prefer twenty-twenty vision to rose-colored glasses in viewing how our government works and why. With an Introduction by Peter Quinnand a New Afterword","1995-11-01","2022-06-10 09:18:45","2022-06-10 09:18:45","","","75","","","","","Plunkitt of Tammany Hall","","","","","Penguin","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: q3SlQoxj_4UC","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=q3SlQoxj_4UC","","Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections; History / United States / 19th Century; Biography & Autobiography / Political","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The tactics of Gustav Adolf postulated a vastly improved fire-discipline, and long practice in the combination of arms. The new emphasis on training and drill seemed to contemporaries to reinforce their already established convictions about the best way to recruit an army. A mercenary army cared not at all if the war were prolonged, or fought far from home; it economized the state's own manpower, and hence its wealth; the system of recruiting through captains relieved the government of a good deal of administrative work. Military writers such as Machiavelli and Lazarus von Schwendi had urged the superiority of the citizen army, with many a backward glance at the military virtues of republican Rome. The difference was that they became standing armies too. And this change arose mainly from the obvious need to make them less burdensome to the state.","1995","2022-06-10 09:18:43","2022-06-10 09:18:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The term appears with increased frequency in anthropological analysis. Indeed, it has become a major concept in the study of peasant societies, somewhat analogous to the concept of the “big man” in certain kinds of chiefdoms, or “fission and fusion” in lineage-type societies. There is, however, considerable ambiguity in the meaning given to the term. Consider, as examples, the following three excerpts from recent anthropological studies:Patronage is founded on the reciprocal relations between patrons and clients. By patron I mean a person who uses his influence to assist and protect some other person, who then becomes his “client”, and in return provides certain services for his patron… Patronage is thus the complex of relations between those who use their influence, social position or some other attribute to assist and protect others, and those whom they so help and protect.","1968-07","2022-06-10 10:35:07","2022-06-10 10:35:07","2022-06-10 10:35:07","377-400","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If network cohesion is enhanced by multiple connections between members of a group, for example, then the higher the global minimum of the number of independent paths that connect every pair of nodes in the network, the higher the social cohesion. The cohesiveness of a group is also measured by the extent to which it is not disconnected by removal of 1, 2, 3,..., k actors. Menger’s Theorem proves that these two measures are equivalent. Within this graph theoretic framework, we evaluate various concepts of cohesion and establish the validity of a pair of related measures: 1. Connectivity—the minimum number k of its actors whose removal would not allow the group to remain connected or would reduce the group to but a single member—measures the social cohesion of a group at a general level. 2. Conditional density measures cohesion on a finer scale as a proportion of ties beyond that required for connectivity k over the number of ties that would force it to k+ 1. Calibrated for successive values of k, these two measures combine into an aggregate measure of social cohesion, suitable for both small- and large-scale network studies. Using these measures to define the core of a new methodology of cohesive blocking, we offer hypotheses about the consequences of cohesive blocks for social groups and their members, and explore empirical examples that illustrate the significance, theoretical relevance, and predictiveness of cohesive blocking in a variety of substantively important applications in sociology.","2001","2022-06-10 10:34:52","2022-06-10 10:34:52","2022-06-10 10:34:43","305-359","","1","31","","","The Cohesiveness of Blocks In Social Networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/0081-1750.00098","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\9HQYSDKZ\White 그리고 Harary - 2001 - The Cohesiveness of Blocks In Social Networks Nod.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arguing that most economists use overly abstract models of how the economy operates, Harrison White seeks a richer, more empirically based alternative. In doing so, he offers a more lucid, generalized treatment of the market models described in his important earlier work in order to show how any given market is situated in a broader exchange economy. White argues that the key to economic action is that producers seek market niches to maximize profit and minimize competition. As they do so, they base production decisions not only on anticipated costs from suppliers and anticipated demand from buyers, but also by looking at their competitors. In fact, White asserts, producers act less in response to actual demand than by anticipating it: they gauge where competitors have found demand and thus determine what they can do that is similar and yet different enough to give themselves a special niche. Building on these and related insights, White creates new mathematical models of how the economy works and how the interaction of its sectors creates mutual protection from the uncertainties of business. These models provide new ways of accounting for profits, prices, market shares, and other vital economic phenomena. He shows, for example, that prices are determined by the coalescing of local variables rather than set in terms of averages as implied by the ''law'' of supply and demand. The model of ''pure'' competition favored by economics is deficient, he concludes, as it fails to account for the varied circumstances of particular industries. Throughout, White draws extensively on case studies of American businesses and on recent mathematical and sociological work on networks. Rivaling standard economic theories with its rich empirical grounding, sheer originality, and scholarly rigor, Markets from Networks will resonate in economics and economic sociology for years to come.","2018-06-05","2022-06-10 10:34:48","2022-06-10 10:34:48","2022-06-10 10:34:48","","","","","","","Markets from Networks","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9780691187624 Publication Title: Markets from Networks","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\LXWCKKD5\White - 2018 - Markets from Networks Socioeconomic Models of Pro.pdf","","","Competition; Emergence; Trade-off; Calculation; Case study; Demography; Embedding; Ideal type; Medium of exchange; Positioning (marketing); Prediction; Profession; Social constructionism; Sociocultural evolution; Transfer pricing; Subsidy; Entrepreneurship; Core business; Customer; Diversification (finance); Economics; Economist; Economy; Efficient-market hypothesis; Finance; Financial Performance; Institutional economics; Market (economics); Market participant; Production function; Profit (economics); Supply (economics); Vertical integration; Advertising; Barriers to entry; Behavioral economics; Business manager; Capital budgeting; Cash flow; Chain linking; Cobb–Douglas production function; Comparative statics; Conjectural variation; Consumer Goods; Cost accounting; Cost curve; Countermove; Economic indicator; Economic Theory (journal); Estimation; Factor price; Free entry; General equilibrium theory; Gini Index; Herfindahl index; Idealization; Inbreeding; Industrial organization; Investment; Knightian uncertainty; Line of business; Lock-in (decision-making); Marginal cost; Market clearing; Market failure; Market mechanism; Market orientation; Market profile; Market sector; Microeconomics; Molecule; Monopolistic competition; Monopsony; Natural monopoly; Neoclassical economics; Net income; New institutional economics; Obsolescence; Offer curve; Oligopoly; Opportunity cost; Pareto efficiency; Path dependence; Perfect competition; Postponement; Price discrimination; Pricing; Procurement; Product differentiation; Quality assurance; Relational view; Secondary sector of the economy; State space; Strategic business unit; Substitution effect; Supply and demand; Technical analysis; Total cost; Trust region; Zvi Griliches","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Warfare in cultures from several different world areas is considered, ranging over the Amazon, the Caribbean, the Andes, the Southwestern United States, Southeast Asia, Polynesia, and Malaysia. To explain the origins and maintenance of war in tribal societies, different authors appeal to a broad spectrum of demographic, environmental, historical and biological variables.

William Foote Whyte's account of the Italian American slum he called “Cornerville”—Boston's North End—has been the model for urban ethnography for fifty years.   By mapping the intricate social worlds of street gangs and “corner boys,” Whyte was among the first to demonstrate that a poor community need not be socially disorganized. His writing set a standard for vivid portrayals of real people in real situations. And his frank discussion of his methodology—participant observation—has served as an essential casebook in field research for generations of students and scholars.   This fiftieth anniversary edition includes a new preface and revisions to the methodological appendix. In a new section on the book’s legacy, Whyte responds to challenges to the validity, interpretation, and uses of his data. “The Whyte Impact on the Underdog,” the moving statement by a gang leader who became the author’s first research assistant, is preserved.   “Street Corner Society broke new ground and set a standard for field research in American cities that remains a source of intellectual challenge.”—Robert Washington, Reviews in Anthropology","2012-04-26","2022-06-10 10:34:36","2022-06-10 10:34:36","","","419","","","","","Street Corner Society","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: USECAAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=USECAAAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Social Science / Sociology / Urban; History / United States / State & Local / New England (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, VT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"8AY8ZCJX","book","2015","Wilensky, Harold L.","Organizational Intelligence: Knowledge and Policy in Government and Industry","","978-1-61027-288-9","","","","The prize-winning book Organizational Intelligence focuses on the structural and ideological roots of intelligence (informational and analytical) failures in government, industry, and other institutions. It provides groundbreaking theory and structure to the analysis of decision-making processes and their breakdowns, as well as the interactions among experts and the organizations they inform. In this book, both &quot;organization&quot; and &quot;intelligence&quot; are taken to their larger meanings, not just focused on the military meaning of intelligence or on one set of institutions in society. Astute illustrations of intelligence failures abound from real-world cases, such as foreign policy (the Bay of Pigs, Soviet predictions in the Cuban missile crisis), military (civilian bombing of Germany, Pearl Harbor), financial (AmEx&#39;s investment in a vegetable oil guru), economics (the Council of Economic Advisers) and industrial production (Ford&#39;s Edsel), as well as many other telling arenas and disciplines. Economic, cultural, legal, and political contexts are considered, as well as the more known institutions of government and commerce. The new Classics of the Social Sciences edition from Quid Pro Books features a 2015 Foreword from Neil J. Smelser, University Professor Emeritus at Berkeley and former chair of its sociology department. He writes that the book remains &quot;one of the classics in organizational studies, and—in ways I will indicate—it is still directly relevant to current and future problems of organizational life. ... What makes this book a classic? It is a disciplined, intelligent, and elegant model of applied social science. ... The text itself, richly documented empirically, yields an informed and balanced account of the decision-making process as this is shaped by the quality of information available (and unavailable) to and used (and not used) by organizational leaders.&quot; Reviews of the book at the time it was written similarly attest to the originality and breadth of its interdisciplinary analysis. Amitai Etzioni wrote in the American Sociological Review: &quot;This book opens a whole new field — the macrosociology of knowledge. It is as different from the traditional sociology of knowledge as the study of interaction is from that of the structure of total societies.&quot; He adds, &quot;The power of Wilensky&#39;s contribution is further magnified by his historical perspective. He studies structures and processes, but not in a vacuum.&quot; Gordon Craig wrote in The Reporter that the book&#39;s examples from organizations &quot;show a similar tendency to believe what they want to believe, to become the victims of their own slogans and propaganda, and to resist or to silence warning voices that challenge their assumptions.... In his fascinating analysis of intelligence failures and their causes ... in the public and private sectors, Wilensky finds that the most disastrous miscalculations are those which have occurred in the field of governmental operations, especially foreign policy and national security.&quot; The book explains how such highly institutionalized actors are vulnerable to informational pathologies.The new digital edition features active Contents, a fully linked Index, linked notes, and proper ebook formatting. It is a modern, quality, and authorized re-presentation of a classic work in social science and organizational studies.","2015-02-14","2022-06-10 10:34:30","2022-06-10 10:34:30","","","296","","","","","Organizational Intelligence","","","","","Quid Pro Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: _smsBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=_smsBgAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Information Management; History / Military / Strategy; Political Science / Intelligence & Espionage; Political Science / Intergovernmental Organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preferential and random mixing among the sex‐role subgroups are modeled via a concept of partnership‐formation rates for pairs of individuals. Models of differing mixing assumptions are compared via a concept of reference reproductive rate. Under the assumption of no risk associated with insertive anal intercourse, explicit epidemic thresholds are determined; epidemic intensity increases with increasing size of the dual‐role (insertive and receptive) subpopulation. Other results indicate that there is a threshold for reproductive rates which determines whether or not random mixing yields a more severe epidemic than a form of segregated mixing, and that for fixed epidemiological conditions, a certain level of like‐with‐like preference, rather than random mixing, yields a worst‐case scenario.","1989-11-01","2022-06-10 10:34:23","2022-06-10 10:34:23","2022-06-10 10:34:22","434-449","","4","26","","","Homosexual role separation and AIDS epidemics","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/00224498909551526","","","","","AIDS epidemic; anal intercourse; HIV risk behaviors; math models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How are national and regional regimes formed? How are conflicting political interests brought together as policies are developed in the Soviet Union? In Patronage and Politics in the USSR, first published in 1991, Professor John Willerton offers major insights into the patronage networks that have dominated elite mobility, regime formation, and governance in the Soviet Union during the past twenty-five years. Using the biographical and career details of over two thousand national leaders and regional officials in Azerbaijan and Lithuania, John Willerton traces the patron-client relations underlying recruitment, mobility, and policymaking. He explores the strategies of power consolidation and coalition building used by Soviet chief executives since 1964 as well as the institutional links and policy outcomes that have resulted from network politics. The author also assesses the manner and extent to which leaders in politically stable and less stable settings, spanning different national cultural contexts, have relied upon patronage networks to consolidate power and to govern. Finally, Professor Willerton explores how, in a period of dramatic change, patron-client networks may have given way to institutionalised interest groups and political parties.","1992","2022-06-10 10:34:20","2022-06-10 10:34:20","","","323","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: nbDiDWfVjj8C","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=nbDiDWfVjj8C","","Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties; Political Science / Political Process / General; Political Science / World / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It considers the transaction to be the ultimate unit of microeconomic analysis, and defines hierarchical transactions as ones for which a single administrative entity spans both sides of the transaction, some form of subordination prevails and, typically, consolidated ownership obtains.        Discusses the advantages of the transactional approach by examining three issues: price discrimination, insurance, and vertical integration.          Develops the concept of the organizational failure framework, and demonstrates why it is always the combination of human with environmental factors, not either taken by itself, that causes transactional problems. The study also describes each of the transactional relations of interest, and presents the advantages of internal organization with respect to the transactional condition.                  The analysis explains why primary work groups of the peer group and simple hierarchy types arise. The same transactional factor which impede autonomous contracting between individuals also impede market exchange between technologically separable work groups. Peer groups can be understood as an internal organizational response to the frictions of intermediate product markets, while conglomerate organization can be seen as a response to failures in the capital market. In both contexts, the same human factors, such  as bounded rationality and opportunism, occur.                 Examines the reasons for and properties of the employment relation, which is commonly associated with voluntary subordination. The analysis attempts better to assess the employment relation in circumstances where workers acquire, during the course of the employment, significant job-specific skills and knowledge. The study compares alternative labor-contracting modes and demonstrates that collective organization is helpful in enhancing the acquisition of idiosyncratic knowledge and skills by the work force.                 The study then examines more complex structures -- the movement from simple hierarchies to the vertical integration of firms, then multidivisional structures, conglomerates, monopolies and oligopolies.                 Discusses the market structure in relation to technical and organizational innovation.  The study proposes a systems approach to the innovation process. Its purpose is to permit the realization of  the distinctive advantages of both small and large firms which apply at different stages of the innovation process. The analysis also examines the relation of organizational innovation to technological innovation.

When this classic work was first published in 1975, it created a new discipline and started a tumultuous round in the age-old nature versus nurture debate. Although voted by officers and fellows of the international Animal Behavior Society the most important book on animal behavior of all time, Sociobiology is probably more widely known as the object of bitter attacks by social scientists and other scholars who opposed its claim that human social behavior, indeed human nature, has a biological foundation. The controversy surrounding the publication of the book reverberates to the present day. In the introduction to this Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Edition, Edward O. Wilson shows how research in human genetics and neuroscience has strengthened the case for a biological understanding of human nature. Human sociobiology, now often called evolutionary psychology, has in the last quarter of a century emerged as its own field of study, drawing on theory and data from both biology and the social sciences. For its still fresh and beautifully illustrated descriptions of animal societies, and its importance as a crucial step forward in the understanding of human beings, this anniversary edition of Sociobiology: The New Synthesis will be welcomed by a new generation of students and scholars in all branches of learning.","2000-03-24","2022-06-10 10:34:00","2022-06-10 10:34:00","","","712","","","","","Sociobiology","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FEsCBAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=FEsCBAAAQBAJ","","Science / Life Sciences / Biology; Science / Life Sciences / Evolution; Science / Life Sciences / Zoology / General; Nature / Animals / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Political coalescence within distinct geographical areas was driven by the accumulation of the means to make war by those who held power. Organized violence, or warfare, became an exclusive prerogative of these states which disarmed their subject populations whilst devising ever more sophisticated methods of harnessing their productive capacity to sustain larger armed forces. Changes in the conduct of war, including those at the tactical or battlefield level, have to be understood within this wider context.","1999","2022-06-10 10:33:58","2022-06-10 10:33:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","","","","","","","","Num Pages: 30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The war hero celebrated by Homer? Or the fourth century ""political animal"" described by Aristotle? In this book, leading scholars show what it meant to be Greek during the classical period of Greek civilization.  The Greeks offers the most complete portraits available of typical Greek personages from Athens to Sparta, Arcadia, Thessaly and Epirus to the city-states of Asia Minor, to the colonies of the Black Sea, southern Italy, and Sicily. Looking at the citizen, the religious believer, the soldier, the servant, the peasant, and others, they show what—in the Greek relationships with the divine, with nature, with others, and with the self—made him ""different"" in his ways of acting, thinking, and feeling.  The contributors to this volume are Jean-Pierre Vernant, Claude Mosse, Yvon Garlan, Giuseppe Cambiano, Luciano Canfora, James Redfield, Charles Segal, Oswyn Murray, Mario Vegetti, and Philippe Borgeaud.","1995-05","2022-06-10 10:20:40","2022-06-10 10:20:40","","","332","","","","","","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: AtIu43UCDu4C","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=AtIu43UCDu4C","","History / General; History / Ancient / Greece; History / Europe / Greece","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These groups lived in captivity and were well-established: i. e. they had an extensive network of genealogical relationships. The study pays special attention to agonistic interactions with three or more participants. Its main purpose is an analysis of the way dyadic agonistic relations (e.g. dominance relations) are affected by third group members and the relations among these. The paper presents data on the ontogeny of ‘dependent dominance’, the ‘control role’ of the α-♂, and the functions of different types of alliances. Zusammenfassung Viele neue Untersuchungen zeigen, daß dyadische soziale Beziehungen in Affengruppen von Dritt-Individuen und von den Beziehungen zwischen diesen Dritten beeinflußt werden. Unter den agonistischen Beziehungen bei zwei Gruppen von Macaca fascicularis in Gefangenschaft wurden deshalb die Auseinandersetzungen mit drei oder mehr Teilnehmern speziell untersucht. Die Arbeit diskutiert die Verteilungen von zwei verschiedenen Arten von Allianzen über die Gruppenmitglieder, nämlich Aktor-Allianzen, in denen ein drittes Tier sich dem Aggressor anschließt, und Reaktor-Allianzen, in denen das dritte Tier sich dem Angegriffenen oder Angedrohten anschließt. Der Akzent liegt dabei auf 1) der Wichtigkeit der Verwandtschaftsbeziehungen für das Auftreten dieser Allianzen und ihrer Rolle in der Entwicklung von „abhängigen Rangverhältnissen”, 2) der „Kontrollrolle” des α-♂ und 3) der Funktion von ausgebreiteten Allianzen gegen rangtiefe Affen. Daneben werden noch einige allgemeine Aspekte der Verteilung des aggressiven und ängstlichen Verhaltens behandelt. Es zeigte sich, daß sowohl der beschreibende wie der erklärende Wert des Dominanzkonzeptes für die Beziehungen zwischen Senioren unserer zwei Affengruppen hoch war. In bezug auf die Beziehungen von Junioren war dies hingegen nicht der Fall. Vergleiche zwischen den Verteilungen von vier verschiedenen Verhaltenselementen, die wir als Dominanzkriterien anwendeten, scheinen darauf hinzuweisen, daß man viel mehr bestimmte Stadien unterscheiden kann in dem Prozeß, in dem Junioren in den einzelnen dyadischen Beziehungen ihre endgültigen Dominanzpositionen erreichen, als bestimmte Rangpositionen. In diesem langen und komplizierten Prozeß scheint das Alter ebenso wie unterstützende Beziehungen ein wichtiger Faktor zu sein. Mütter unterstützen ihre Verwandten bei Auseinandersetzungen mit Nicht-Verwandten in Reaktor-Allianzen wie in Aktor-Allianzen. Dieses Verhalten verschafft dem Jungtier eine kräftige Waffe gegen alle Gruppenmitglieder, die den Müttern unterlegen sind, einschließlich der Erwachsenen. In bezug auf die sogenannte „Kontrollrolle” des α-♂ erwies es sich als sinnvoll, zwischen Interventionen zugunsten der aggressiven Partei (d. h. Anschließ-Aggression) und der angegriffenen Partei (d. h. Schutz-Aggression) zu unterscheiden und die Effekte solcher Interventionen zu studieren. Dabei stellte sich heraus, daß die α-♂ ♂ der beiden Gruppen angegriffene Individuen zwar viel häufiger, aber bestimmt nicht effektiver schützten als andere Beschützer. Ihre Interventionen zugunsten des Aggressors verkürzten die Auseinandersetzungen nicht; vielmehr hatten sie manchmal sogar einen gegenteiligen Effekt. Die Daten ergaben, daß gewisse aggressive Verhaltenselemente einen Aggressionstypus darstellen, dessen Auftreten die Aussicht auf Anschließ-Aggression von anderen erhöht. Es scheint nicht so zu sein, daß die Auslösung aggressiver Unterstützung nur ein durch den Aktor nicht beabsichtigtes Nebenprodukt dieses Aggressionstypus ist, denn die Neigung der Individuen, diesen Aggressionstypus gegen bestimmte Gegner anzuwenden, entsprach ihrer Neigung, sich auch selber bei Aggression durch andere gegen dieselben Gegner anzuschließen. Indirekt deutet dies darauf hin, daß dieser Aggressionstypus Teil einer Strategie zur Allianzbildung darstellt. Aktor-Allianzen, d. h. Allianzen zwischen zwei oder mehr Aggressoren, waren, wenn nicht ausschließlich, so doch hauptsächlich gegen rangniedrige Gruppenmitglieder gerichtet, und zwar in relativ stärkerem Maße als die Aktionen einzelner Aggressoren. Dieses Ergebnis ist ziemlich überraschend, denn man erwartet doch, daß die Hauptfunktion der Allianzen darin besteht, ein Instrument zu bilden, mit dem Dominante herausgefordert und besiegt werden können. Die Möglichkeit wird erörtert, daß viele dieser Allianzen gegen rangniedrige Tiere eher der Regulation der Beziehungen zwischen den Allianzteilnehmern dienen als der der Beziehungen zum Gegner.","1977","2022-06-10 10:20:38","2022-07-01 04:08:57","2022-06-10 10:20:38","225-282","","3","44","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1439-0310.1977.tb00995.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It offers a historical overview of the problem of deception in related fields of animal behavior, philosophical analyses of the meaning and significance of deception in evolutionary and psychological theories, and diverse perspectives on deception--philosophical, ecological, evolutionary, ethological, developmental, psychological, anthropological, and historical.  The contributions gathered herein afford scientists the opportunity to discover something about the formal properties of deception, enabling them to explore and evaluate the belief that one set of descriptive and perhaps explanatory structures is suitable for both biological and psychological phenomena.","1986-01-01","2022-06-10 10:20:35","2022-06-10 10:20:35","","","424","","","","","Deception","","","","","SUNY Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: eHV_8YC_NL0C","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=eHV_8YC_NL0C","","Psychology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"TMP3Y873","book","1989","De Waal, Frans B. M.","Peacemaking Among Primates","","978-0-674-65921-6","","","","Does biology condemn the human species to violence and war? Previous studies of animal behavior incline us to answer yes, but the message of this book is considerably more optimistic. Without denying our heritage of aggressive behavior, Frans de Waal describes powerful checks and balances in the makeup of our closest animal relatives, and in so doing he shows that to humans making peace is as natural as making war. In this meticulously researched and absorbing account, we learn in detail how different types of simians cope with aggression, and how they make peace after fights. Chimpanzees, for instance, reconcile with a hug and a kiss, whereas rhesus monkeys groom the fur of former adversaries. By objectively examining the dynamics of primate social interactions, de Waal makes a convincing case that confrontation should not be viewed as a barrier to sociality but rather as an unavoidable element upon which social relationships can be built and strengthened through reconciliation. The author examines five different species—chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, stump-tailed monkeys, bonobos, and humans—and relates anecdotes, culled from exhaustive observations, that convey the intricacies and refinements of simian behavior. Each species utilizes its own unique peacemaking strategies. The bonobo, for example, is little known to science, and even less to the general public, but this rare ape maintains peace by means of sexual behavior divorced from reproductive functions; sex occurs in all possible combinations and positions whenever social tensions need to be resolved. “Make love, not war” could be the bonobo slogan. De Waal’s demonstration of reconciliation in both monkeys and apes strongly supports his thesis that forgiveness and peacemaking are widespread among nonhuman primates—an aspect of primate societies that should stimulate much needed work on human conflict resolution.","1989","2022-06-10 10:20:31","2022-07-01 04:25:07","","","322","","","","","","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5at0TN8U6RMC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=5at0TN8U6RMC","","Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Richard Swedberg answers these questions in this thought-provoking book of conversations with well-known economists and sociologists. Among the economists interviewed are Gary Becker, Amartya Sen, Kenneth Arrow, and Albert O. Hirschman; the sociologists include Daniel Bell, Harrison White, James Coleman, and Mark Granovetter. The picture that emerges is that economists and sociologists have paid little attention to each other during most of the twentieth century: social problems have been analyzed as if they had no economic dimension and economic problems as if they had no social dimension. Today, however, there is a dialogue between the two fields, as economists take on social topics and as sociologists become interested in rational choice and ""new economic sociology."" The interviewees describe how they came to challenge the present separation between economics and sociology, what they think of the various proposals to integrate the fields, and how they envision the future. The author summarizes the results of the conversations in the final chapter. The individual interviews also serve as superb introductions to the work of these scholars.","1990-02-14","2022-06-10 10:12:00","2022-06-10 10:12:00","","","374","","","","","Economics and Sociology","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: j6V2rQEu2tUC","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=j6V2rQEu2tUC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Muriquis spent significantly more of their time in primary forest than in other habitat types. However, their range use was highly seasonal, and appeared to correspond to the availability of preferred fruit sources. Muriquis tended to ""camp-out"" in areas where large fruit trees were present, and range farther when no such food resources were available.Muriquis devoted an average of 32% of their feeding time to fruits and seeds, 51% to leaves, and 11% to flowers. Comparisons between the availablility of potential food sources and muriqui feeding behavior suggested that murquis are highly selective feeders. They fed preferentially at large fruit patches which supported a greater number of simultaneous feeders than did leaf patches. Adult females were more likely than males to feed alone in patches.Murquis spent 62% of their time less than 10 meters from one another, yet only 34 agonistic interactions were observed. Females never aggressively competed for food, and males never aggressively competed for copulations. Females were codominant with males. These data suggest that the costs of aggression are inordinately high for muriquis, and that inferences about primate behavior based on ecological variables must consider the energetics of competition over limited resources. function show_abstract() {   $('#abstract1').hide();   $('#abstract2').show();   $('#abstract_expand').hide(); } ▼Показать полностью","1987","2022-06-10 10:11:52","2022-06-10 10:11:52","2022-06-10 10:11:52","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","eLibrary.ru","","","","","","","Anthropology, Physical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The accumulation of data on a broader taxonomic diversity of primates has contributed to advances in the use of comparative methods for gaining insights into interspecific variation in behavior patterns, but the incorporation of intraspecific variation into comparative models of behavior has lagged behind. This delay can be attributed, in part, to the slow rate at which the interacting effects of life history and demography on behavior emerge in slow-growing, long-lived primates. It may also reflect the anthropocentric foundation of field primatology, which historically focused on interspecific comparisons with humans instead of interpopulation variation among primates. Conservation concerns have stimulated new thinking about the importance of populations and the range of behavioral variation that populations maintain. The integration of intra- and interspecific behavioral variation will distinguish the next generation of comparative models in primatology, and set a new agenda as field primatology comes of age.

C.","Social Dynamics of Male Muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides hypoxanthus)","Behaviour","","0005-7959","","https://www.jstor.org/stable/4535925","We investigated patterns of sociality among wild male northern muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides hypoxanthus) to explore some of the possible ways in which within-group scramble competition might shape their social and mating strategies. The 13 adult males in our study group spent an average of 54.5±4.2% of their time in proximity to at least one other adult male. They were more likely to associate with one another, but not with adult females, when they were resting than when they were feeding. Embrace rates were positively related to the proportion of time males spent in proximity during resting. Males that associated closely with one another tended to interact more often, although individual differences in male social styles and rates of interactions were apparent. Young adult males had significantly higher social maintenance rates than the oldest males in our sample, but no other effects of age were detected in any of our other behavioral comparisons. In roughly 20% of all dyads, one male valued the association significantly more than the other. Males tended to value associates with higher mating success than themselves, and to share access to the same females on the same days with their closest associates. Neither of the two pairs of maternal brothers in our study group were important associates to their kin, but brothers shared copulations in the same polyadic copulation partnerships with one another. Although still preliminary, our findings suggest that muriqui males differentiate among their possible social partners in ways that may minimize the variance in their mating success under the unusual conditions imposed by scramble competition for reproductive opportunities.","2002","2022-06-10 10:11:46","2022-06-10 10:11:46","2022-06-10 10:11:46","315-342","","2/3","139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Brill","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\8H9LV34B\Strier 등 - 2002 - Social Dynamics of Male Muriquis (Brachyteles arac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He came to know it intimately and was welcomed by its residents, who are Italian, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Negro. Suttles contends that the residents of a slum neighborhood have a set of standards for behavior that take precedence over the more widely held ""moral standards"" of ""straight"" society. These standards arise out of the specific experience of each locality, are peculiar to it, and largely determine how the neighborhood people act. One of the tasks of urban sociology, according to Suttles, is to explore why and how slum communities provide their inhabitants with these local norms. The Social Order of the Slum is the record of such an exploration, and it defines theoretical principles and concepts that will aid in subsequent research.","1968","2022-06-10 10:11:41","2022-06-10 10:11:41","","","266","","","","","The Social Order of the Slum","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FjmU_wcaL_YC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=FjmU_wcaL_YC","","Social Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"R4ZN2TS7","book","2017","Castañeda, Ernesto; Schneider, Cathy Lisa","Collective Violence, Contentious Politics, and Social Change: A Charles Tilly Reader","","978-1-351-79278-3","","","","Charles Tilly is among the most influential American sociologists of the last century. For the first time, his pathbreaking work on a wide array of topics is available in one comprehensive reader. This manageable and readable volume brings together many highlights of Tilly’s large and important oeuvre, covering his contribution to the following areas: revolutions and social change; war, state making, and organized crime; democratization; durable inequality; political violence; migration, race, and ethnicity; narratives and explanations.  The book connects Tilly’s work on large-scale social processes such as nation-building and war to his work on micro processes such as racial and gender discrimination. It includes selections from some of Tilly’s earliest, influential, and out of print writings, including The Vendée; Coercion, Capital and European States; the classic ""War Making and State Making as Organized Crime;"" and his more recent and lesser-known work, including that on durable inequality, democracy, poverty, economic development, and migration. Together, the collection reveals Tilly’s complex, compelling, and distinctive vision and helps place the contentious politics approach Tilly pioneered with Sidney Tarrow and Doug McAdam into broader context. The editors abridge key texts and, in their introductory essay, situate them within Tilly’s larger opus and contemporary intellectual debates. The chapters serve as guideposts for those who wish to study his work in greater depth or use his methodology to examine the pressing issues of our time. Read together, they provide a road map of Tilly’s work and his contribution to the fields of sociology, political science, history, and international studies. This book belongs in the classroom and in the library of social scientists, political analysts, cultural critics, and activists.","2017-05-08","2022-06-10 10:11:23","2022-06-10 10:11:23","","","420","","","","","Collective Violence, Contentious Politics, and Social Change","","","","","Taylor & Francis","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: giUlDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=giUlDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How, he asks, do long-lasting, systematic inequalities in life chances arise, and how do they come to distinguish members of different socially defined categories of persons? Exploring representative paired and unequal categories, such as male/female, black/white, and citizen/noncitizen, Tilly argues that the basic causes of these and similar inequalities greatly resemble one another. In contrast to contemporary analyses that explain inequality case by case, this account is one of process. Categorical distinctions arise, Tilly says, because they offer a solution to pressing organizational problems. Whatever the ""organization"" is—as small as a household or as large as a government—the resulting relationship of inequality persists because parties on both sides of the categorical divide come to depend on that solution, despite its drawbacks. Tilly illustrates the social mechanisms that create and maintain paired and unequal categories with a rich variety of cases, mapping out fertile territories for future relational study of durable inequality.","1998-03-02","2022-06-10 10:11:21","2022-06-10 10:11:21","2022-06-10 10:11:21","","","","","","","","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1525/9780520924222 Publication Title: Durable Inequality","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\HUTRBKUZ\Tilly - 1998 - Durable Inequality.pdf","","","representation; politics; capitalism; analysis; feminism; philosophy; government; adaptation; binary; categorical pairs; categories; contemporary; cultural history; cultural studies; dualism; equality; exploitation; feminist; inequality; manifesto; nationalism; political; social history; social inequality; social justice; social studies; systemic inequality; systemic racism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"HVNG2Y2B","book","1990","Tolz, Vera","The USSR's Emerging Multiparty System","","978-0-275-93838-3","","","","Throughout the history of the USSR, groups of like-minded people have gathered, without official permission, to discuss issues of common interest. They had their predecessors in prerevolutionary voluntary associations and political parties. During the 1960s it became easier and less dangerous than in the previous period of Stalin's rule to engage in activities outside government control. Indeed, since the de-Stalinization campaign in the 1950s, Soviet society has been slowly asserting its independence, at least in areas nominally nonpolitical. Nevertheless, until Gorbachev's drive for liberalization achieved some momentum, the creation of unsanctioned groups often continued to provoke persecution of their members. In this book, Vera Tolz studies these unsanctioned groups and reveals the effect they are having on the Soviet political system. In 1990, primarily because of pressure from these unofficial movements, the Communist party was forced to relinquish its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power. In other words, a multiparty system had emerged in the USSR by the end of the period under observation in this book.From the time that voluntary associations of Soviet people were permitted to emerge from the underground and openly participate in official public life (1987), their role in the political and social life of the country has been rapidly expanding. By 1989, new sociopolitical groups, especially in the Baltic republics and Transcaucasia, started to pose not only a challenge but also a threat to the power of the Communist party. The emergence of a multiparty system in the Soviet Union, with various political groups pursuing different--and at times opposing--goals, is coinciding with a period during which the central authorities are being inconsistent in implementing democratic reforms. Representatives of new movements are often politically inexperienced, and the Communist party is facing a serious crisis, which makes the political situation in the Soviet Union highly unpredictable and highlights the difficulties that the country faces in moving toward a more democratic system","1990","2022-06-10 10:11:20","2022-07-01 04:28:42","","","154","","","","","","","","","","Greenwood Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: seuAyIqThNcC","","","https://books.google.ru/books?id=seuAyIqThNcC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Filled with insights about the mental stamina and emotional clarity that peak performance requires, this is an indispensable story for young athletes, coaches, educators, and anyone interested in the astonishing potential of team sports to unlock individual growth. THE GAME WILL NEVER BE THE SAME Magic doesn't seem possible for the West Bottom Badgers. They're the lowest-ranked basketball team in their league, and they live in the poorest neighborhood in Dren. Nobody expects them to succeed at anything. Plus, every kid on the team has secret struggles of his own.When a new coach named Professor Wizenard arrives on the first day of training camp, the Badgers can't explain the magical-seeming things they see and hear. Every player experiences unique and strange visions--visions that challenge everything they thought they knew about basketball, and about their lives and their secrets off the court. To survive the increasingly intense ordeals of training, the Badgers will need to take unimaginable risks, learn to trust their teammates, and confront the darkness within themselves.","2019-03","2022-06-21 17:55:46","2022-06-21 17:55:46","","","592","","","","","The Wizenard Series","","","","","Granity Studios","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: lW4uuQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=lW4uuQEACAAJ","","Young Adult Fiction / Fantasy / Contemporary; Young Adult Fiction / Social Themes / General; Young Adult Fiction / Sports & Recreation / Basketball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book is a theoretical and comparative study of neopatrimonialism in Africa and across world regions. Although such practices are widespread in other parts of the world, the African neopatrimonial state has also become a global prototype of the anti-developmental state. This volume calls for a reappraisal of the genesis and interpretations of the concepts of patrimonialism and neopatrimonialism. Expert contributors consider recent debates in Africa through the study of democracy, clientelism, the ‘big man’ syndrome (Kenya), the rise of ‘godfatherism’ (Nigeria), ‘warlordism’ (Liberia) and the neopatrimonial state on a day to day basis (Niger). They discuss patrimonialism and neopatrimonialism from Latin America to Europe, Central Asia and Asia-Pacific, to weave a comparative analysis of the interplay between public policies and private interest. Neopatrimonialism in Africa and Beyond is an important and timely volume that will be of interest to students and scholars of international politics, African studies, sociology and international development.","2013-03-01","2022-06-21 17:55:02","2022-06-21 17:55:02","","","273","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: M3lcBAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=M3lcBAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He focuses upon the ties between foreign firms and African rulers in Sierra Leone, where politicians and warlords use private networks that exploit relationships with international businesses to buttress their wealth and so extend their powers of patronage. This permits them to expand the reach of their governments in unorthodox ways, but in the process they undermine the bureaucracty of their own states. Dr Reno suggests that as the post-colonial state is eroded there is a return to the enclave economies and private armies that characterised the pre-colonial and colonial arrangements between European businessmen or administrators and some African political figures.","2008-12-11","2022-06-21 17:54:37","2022-06-21 17:54:37","","","244","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Gl8-PwAACAAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / International Relations / General; History / Africa / General; History / Modern / 20th Century / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Elsewhere, the state has played a crucial role in facilitating capitalist expansion, but in postcolonial Africa one finds a form of neopatrimonialism - personal rule - that introduces a variety of economic irrationalities. Productive economic activities are impeded by the political instability, systemic corruption and maladminstration associated with personal rule. In extreme cases, a downward spiral of political-economic decline is set in motion that is difficult to halt and reverse. Is personal rule simply a euphemism for ineptitude and mismanagement? The authors argue that it is not; it operates according to a particular political rationality that shapes a ruler's actions when, in the absence of legitimate authority, he is confronted with the challenge of governing an unintegrated peasant society. Neopatrimonialism is essentially an adaptation of colonial-inspired political institutions to peculiar historical and social conditions. This book focuses on the political factor as an important cause of Africa's economic ills. It analyses the social conditions impelling political adaptation and the consequences of personal rule for economic life, and surveys creative responses to the predicament African people now face.","1985-11-29","2022-06-21 17:53:40","2022-06-21 17:53:40","","","204","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=7ZYP0r-mu7UC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; History / Africa / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet at the same time they often lack the technical knowledge to assess complex proposals intended to deal with these issues. Written by a uniquely diverse group of academics, policy analysts, and activists, Civilizing Globalization presents in clear, non-technical language the dangers of unfettered global markets, as well as a new vision of globalization regulated to respect social and ecological needs. The contributors show that it is morally and practically imperative to begin thinking about how to deal with this crisis.

Well-known African Studies scholar Richard Sandbrook argues that Africa's problems will not be solved until order is created. And in the creation of order, politics is primary. In this his eighth book on Africa, Sandbrook explores the realities and possibilities of democracy in Africa. He argues for the necessity of a ""virtuous"" and self-reinforcing circle of civil and political rights, growing prosperity, and state renovation. In the end, says Sandbrook, Africa's tragedy is that external as well as internal constraints operate--and that both require attention. He makes a radical call for a supportive social-democratic reform of globalization.","2000","2022-06-21 17:52:50","2022-06-21 17:52:50","","","193","","","","","Closing the Circle","","","","","Between The Lines","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: rnXxDQW9VL0C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=rnXxDQW9VL0C","","Political Science / History & Theory; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries; Political Science / International Relations / General; Business & Economics / Economics / Comparative","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing from extensive interviews with pivotal architects—from Philip Johnson, who was among the first to introduce European modernism to America, to Peter Eisenman, identified with a new ""deconstructionist"" style—she analyzes the complex tensions that exist between economic interest, professional status, and architectural product. She investigates the symbolic awards and recognition accorded by prestigious journals and panels, exposing the inner workings of a profession in a precarious social position. Larson captures the struggles around status, place, and power as architects seek to redefine their very purpose in contemporary America. The author's novel approach in synthesizing sociological research and theory proposes nothing less than a new cultural history of architecture. This is a ground-breaking contribution to the study of culture and the sociology of knowledge, as well as to architectural and urban history. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press’s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

Malaysia, where an intimate relationship has been forged between the state and business in an effort to create Malay capitalists, presents an interesting and illuminating case in the debate. In this work Peter Searle identifies the complex interaction between the state, the dominant political party (UMNO) and business as the source of dynamism or defeat in the development of Malay capitalists. He also challenges a common view that Chinese business groups are completely different from Malay business groups.  Overall this study argues against drawing sharp contrasts between dependency and self-reliance, between state and capital, and between rent-seekers and true &#39;productive&#39; capitalists. For it is from that amalgam of categories and groups the study concludes that a form of capitalism is emerging in Malaysia which is nonetheless remarkably dynamic and resilient, despite its unorthodox origins.","1998-11-01","2022-06-21 17:46:50","2022-06-21 17:46:50","","","344","","","","","The Riddle of Malaysian Capitalism","","","","","University of Hawaii Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: XpuovMTBl2MC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=XpuovMTBl2MC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Business & Economics / International / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It does this through 16 essays written by Prof. Linda Y C Lim, an early and long-established scholar of these subjects, and published over a 35-year period. For Singapore, often considered the world&#39;s most successful economy, the essays highlight the determining role of government&#39;s industrial and social policy through to the present day, when the growth model of the past faces many external market and domestic resource constraints. In the rest of Southeast Asia, in contrast, the essays explore how private sector business, dominated by the locally-domiciled ethnic Chinese minority, thrived and drove economic growth in underdeveloped markets with imperfect institutions, and consider if and how this might change with China&#39;s increasing presence in the regional economy. A final set of essays analyzes the forces underlying women&#39;s employment, from labor-intensive Southeast Asian export factories in the 1980s to Singapore&#39;s foreign-labor-dependent economy and its current productivity challenges. Taken together, the essays show how government, business and labor interact in the process of economic development.","2017-12-07","2022-06-21 17:34:07","2022-06-21 17:34:07","","","422","","","","","Business, Government and Labor","","","","","World Scientific","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IPlGDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=IPlGDwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Business & Economics / International / General; Business & Economics / Globalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This revised, updated, and expanded edition of The Max Weber Dictionary reflects up-to-the-moment threads of inquiry and introduces the most recent translations and references.

More than an elementary dictionary, however, this work makes a contribution to the general culture and legacy of Weber's work. In addition to entries on broad topics like religion, law, and the West, the completed German definitive edition of Weber's work (Max Weber Gesamtausgabe) necessitated a wealth of new entries and added information on topics like pragmatism and race and racism.

Currently the most unstable and dangerous dispute is the one over the Paracel and Spratly islands in the South China Sea. With their potentially rich and accessible petroleum resources, these islands have become the new arena of conflict for the 1970s and 1980s, China having already fought a war with South Vietnam over the Paracel Islands. This book, based on a wealth of primary materials in the Chinese language, is the first to make a thorough and overall investigation of China's policy towards these islands.

Chinese governance reflects both a long, indigenous tradition of statecraft and the Leninist legacies of the People's Republic's ruling Communist Party. As China becomes ever more powerful - economically, diplomatically, militarily, and culturally - it becomes increasingly important to understand its governing dynamics. But to what extent can social-science theories of political rule, hierarchy and power, class formation, economic development, urbanization, and demographic and family transition, which were developed in Western contexts, explain China's societal and political dynamics? What sorts of theoretical language have emerged from the study of Chinese society and politics, and how might these theories enable social scientists to view social and political dynamics in other parts of the world in a new light?"" This new four-volume work explores and answers these and other urgent questions by collecting the best foundational and cutting-edge scholarship on Mao-era and contemporary Chinese society and politics. The collection adopts a dual approach. On the one hand, to address the increasing fascination about China among Western scholars and students from a number of disciplines, it collects the best work that empirically describes Chinese society and its politics. On the other hand, to examine the theoretical implications of the study of Chinese society for Western social science, it also brings together the best work to have used empirical examinations of the People's Republic to interrogate theories developed in Western contexts or to develop new theoretical positions.The editors have in particular paid especial attention to cases where debates have arisen about the proper ways of describing and theorizing Chinese governance and social dynamics.","2009","2022-06-21 17:17:34","2022-06-21 17:17:34","","","492","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: j2MnAQAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=j2MnAQAAIAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This introductory textbook provides students with a fundamental understanding of government and politics in China as well as the conceptual ability to explore the general patterns, impacts, and nature of continuities and changes in Chinese politics. Further, it equips students with analytical frameworks by which they can understand, analyse and evaluate the major issues in Chinese politics, including:    The basic methodologies and theoretical controversies in the study of Chinese politics.  The major dimensions, structures, processes, functions and characteristics of the Chinese political system, such as ideology, politics, law, society, economy, and foreign policy.  The impact of power, ideology, and organization on different spheres of Chinese society. The structure, process, and factors in Chinese foreign policy making. Whether China is a ""strategic partner"" or ""potential threat"" to the United States.    By examining contending theoretical models in the study of Chinese politics, this book combines an essentialist approach that keeps focus on the fundamental, unique and defining features of Chinese politics and government with other theoretical approaches or analytical models which reveal and explore the complexities inherent in the Chinese political system.

We focus on provincial leaders, a pool of candidates for top political office, and examine how their chance of being promoted depends on performance - measured by provincial economic growth - and connections with top politicians - measured by past joint work in the same branch of government. A simple theoretical framework suggests that performance and connections may interact, an aspect ignored in the previous literature. Over the period 1993-2009, we find a positive correlation between promotion and growth that is robustly stronger for connected provincial leaders than for unconnected ones. This evidence indicates that performance and connections are complements in the Chinese political selection process. Auxiliary evidence suggests that the documented promotion pattern does not distort the allocation of talent.","2013","2022-06-21 14:29:29","2022-06-21 14:29:29","","","44","","","","","","","","","","Centre for Economic Policy Research","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: cP0UngEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=cP0UngEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What are the social backgrounds and career paths of the new generation of leaders? How do they differ from their predecessors in their responses to perplexing economic and sociopolitical challenges? Drawing upon a wealth of both quantitative and qualitative data on the so-called fourth generation of leaders--those who were young during the Cultural Revolution--Cheng Li sheds valuable light on these key questions. He shows that this group is more diversified than previous generations of CCP leaders in formative experiences, political solidarity, ideological conviction, and occupational background. The author explores the contradictions between political leaders and non-elite peers in the same generation--those approaching middle age who were barred from education during the Mao era and now often are unemployed and disenchanted with the government. The book concludes with the intriguing notion that this generation of leaders may have a better understanding of its peers' needs and concerns and therefore may make the regime more accountable to its people, thus contributing to, rather than opposing, democratic development.","2001","2022-06-21 14:24:56","2022-06-21 14:24:56","","","308","","","","","China's Leaders","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: LUcNg8xYHtEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=LUcNg8xYHtEC","","Political Science / Political Process / Leadership; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In charge of the destiny of a fifth of humanity, it survives despite the collapse of similar systems elsewhere. Few, however, understand the sources of this resilience, or, for that matter, what the Party itself stands for. China’s Dream is the first book to explore the Communist Party as a cultural, rather than a political, entity. It looks at the narratives the Party has created to recount its own history, with the moral story about national rejuvenation and renaissance that these encode. It does not shy away from the thorny issue of how a Party under Mao Zedong, one associated with self-sacrifice, collectivist effort, and anti-individualism, came to pragmatically embrace market capitalism and a new ethics. The tensions to which this gives rise have resulted in a crisis of values, which is now being addressed – with very mixed results – by the CPC. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of contemporary China, Kerry Brown takes us on a unique and fascinating journey through the least understood aspect of China today – not the great economic revolution in the material world, but the deep cultural revolution already underway in Chinese people’s daily lives.","2018-10-29","2022-06-21 09:44:57","2022-06-21 09:44:57","","","189","","","","","China's Dream","","","","","John Wiley & Sons","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 54d1DwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=54d1DwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Globalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In A Social Revolution, Kevan Harris convincingly demonstrates how they are wrong. Previous studies ignore the forceful consequences of three decades of social change following the 1979 revolution. Today, more people in the country are connected to welfare and social policy institutions than to any other form of state organization. In fact, much of Iran’s current political turbulence is the result of the success of these social welfare programs, which have created newly educated and mobilized social classes advocating for change. Based on extensive fieldwork conducted in Iran, Harris shows how the revolutionary regime endured through the expansion of health, education, and aid programs that have both embedded the state in everyday life and empowered its challengers. This focus on the social policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran opens a new line of inquiry into the study of welfare states in countries where they are often overlooked or ignored.","2017-08-08","2022-06-21 09:43:11","2022-06-21 09:43:11","","","330","","","","","A Social Revolution","","","","","Univ of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: fvjBDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=fvjBDgAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General; History / Middle East / Iran","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Die Relevanz dieses Artikels für das Thema der Netzwerkanalyse ergibt sich schon aus dem Titel des Papers, welcher frei übersetzt ""stabile Beziehungen"" lauten könnte. Padgett, der an der University of Chicago eine Professur für Politikwissenschaften inne hat, ist ausserdem auswärtiger Professor am Santa Fe Institute, wo er sich sich seit 15 Jahren mit dem Thema: ""Innovation in Markets - Co-Evolution of State and Market in Renaissance Florence"" beschäftigt. In diesen Rahmen ist auch der hier zu behandelnde Aufsatz einzuordnden. Padgett verfolgt mit der Arbeit die Absicht, seine These zu belegen, dass die Medici im Florenz zur Zeit des Übergangs von Spätmittelalter zur Frührenaissance nicht, wie bisher von Geschichtswissenschaftlern vermutet, ihre immense Macht und Bedeutung erlangten, indem sie die eigene Differenz zum bestehenden System der Oligarchen ausbauten und aus ihren unterschiedlichen sozialen Attributen Kapital schlugen, sondern dass sie den Oligarchen auf struktureller Ebene glichen.

What kind of strategies do governments follow to prevent such revolts? In this paper we argue that the concept of networks is a very powerful tool to understand these issues, as shown ndash; for example ndash; by the prominent role of social networks during the recent revolts in the Arab world. More specifically, we model these types of societies as a game played between a leader, who has to decide the distribution of the aggregate income, and a group of citizens who have the opportunity to revolt if they are unhappy with the distribution (or if they dislike the regime). Coordinated action by citizens is possible because they form nodes in a communication network. However, communication through the network is distorted, which could preclude the emergence of collective action among citizens. The network structure and the distortion level are determinants of the political equilibrium and wealth distribution. The model explains how the dictator could use propaganda, cooptation, and repression to increase his expected utility. We also use our framework to provide a formal proof of Wintrobe's Dictator's Dilemma. Finally, the model is illustrated by applying it to cases in Nigeria, Zaire/Congo and Libya.","2016","2022-06-21 09:41:51","2022-06-21 09:41:51","","","33","","","","","Citizens, Dictators and Networks","","","","","SSRN","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: zLnMzgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=zLnMzgEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Those signature concepts are often considered as China’s well-thought-out strategic plans reflecting Beijing’s concrete geopolitical vision. This book, however, argues that these views are mistaken. It develops a slogan politics approach to study Chinese foreign policy concepts. The overarching argument is that those concepts should be understood as multifunctional slogans for political communication on the domestic and international stages. This book shows how those concepts function as political slogans to (1) declare intent, (2) assert power and test domestic and international support, (3) promote state propaganda, and (4) call for intellectual support. The slogan politics approach highlights the critical role of China’s academic and local actors as well as international actors in shaping China’s foreign policy ideas. It provides critical insights to understand how Chinese domestic actors exert their influence and voice their narratives to influence China’s policy agenda and debate. It suggests that the existing analyses vastly exaggerate Beijing’s capacity to coordinate domestic actors including forging coherent Chinese foreign policy narratives and unifying use of China’s policy concepts.","2020-07-20","2022-06-21 09:40:07","2022-06-21 09:40:07","","","177","","","","","Slogan Politics","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: EFvyDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=EFvyDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / General; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The professional trajectories of Chinese regional leaders are mysterious in many ways. Their promotions and demotions can be ""predictable"" in terms of their age, gender, nationality, education, factions, and previous engagements in the political system. Yet, speaking of their capability, performance, opportunities and arrangements, their future can also be ""unexpected"". Such arrangements are always originated from the Organization (zuzhi) which represents the Chinese Communist Party. What are the factors the organization considers in order to make its final decisions on nominating and appointing a regional leader?  Today’s regional leaders of China will very likely become the central leaders of China in the future. By making an empirical analysis of Chinese regional leaders’ political mobility, Qiao establishes a descriptive political mobility model that reveals leadership trajectories in Chinese politics.","2017-07-14","2022-06-21 09:38:11","2022-06-21 09:38:11","","","197","","","","","Political Mobility of Chinese Regional Leaders","","","","","Taylor & Francis","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4gYqDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4gYqDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the meeting, Mao shook hands with the entire Politburo, probably for the last time in his life. When he greeted alternate Politburo member and Vice Premier Wu Guixian, Mao confessed ""I don't know who you are."" An embarrassed Wu said ""Chairman, we met in 1964 during the national day parade."" Mao compounded her embarrassment by responding ""I didn't know that"" (Mao 1975). It was both surprising and expected that Mao had failed to recognize Wu. On the one hand, Wu's elevation into the Politburo and into the vice premier position had been recommended by Mao himself at the 10th Party Congress less than two years before Mao shook her hand (Teiwes and Sun 2007: 101). It was therefore astonishing that Mao failed to remember the name of his hand-picked political rising star. On the other hand, Wu was far from a revolutionary veteran with whom Mao had worked for decades like Deng Xiaoping or Ye Jianying. Mao greeted those two warmly at the meeting by calling them by their nicknames, ""Xiaoping"" for Deng and ""Old Marshal"" for Ye (Mao 1975). In contrast, Wu had only joined the party in 1958 and had been nothing more than a model worker until the beginning of the Cultural Revolution (Huang 2007). With the formation of the revolutionary committees at every level of governments starting in 1967, Wu found her career enjoying a rocket-like rise toward the center of power. Still, among the millions of model workers who had benefited from a class-based promotion system instituted during the Cultural Revolution, Wu's elevation to the Politburo was striking""--","2022-06-02","2022-06-21 09:37:54","2022-06-21 09:37:54","","","249","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: DntrEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=DntrEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Asia / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Fascism & Totalitarianism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How do changes in network structures explain specific patterns and propensities for policy change? The purpose of this study is to describe the social network structure of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee from 1922 to 2011 and to explore the relationship between changes in the network and policy trends. This study draws on policy network theory, network dynamics, Veto Player Theory and Prospect Theory which together posit that dynamic network structural characteristics influence policy outcomes. I introduce a dynamical theory of policy networks and describe some observable implications. This mixed method analysis is based on a new network dataset and follows two major lines of investigation. A structured, focused comparison of case studies associates changes in the Central Committee's network structure in 1969, 1978, 1982, and 1997 with consequent policy outcomes and demonstrates the explanatory power of the dynamical theory. Statistical analyses of China's foreign policies (1949-1978 and 1984-1995) and China's domestic policies (1984-1995) suggest the dynamical theory is generalizable. Changes in paramount leader and potential competitor centralities and Central Committee centralization are important causal factors explaining the timing and type of intra-Party, domestic, and foreign policies","2013","2022-06-21 09:37:26","2022-06-21 09:37:26","","","293","","","","","A Network Analysis of China's Central Committee","","","","","UMI Dissertation Publishing, ProQuest LLC","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ItSloAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ItSloAEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the role of the 'core' leader and his interactions with other ruling elite are important in understanding Chinese politics, this book attempts to focus on the role of the party chief and how he could become the 'core' of the leadership. Xuezhi Guo provides the most detailed and comprehensive scrutiny of the 'core' of the Chinese Communist Party leadership and meticulously analyses the cultural, philosophical, and ideological origins as well as its evolution throughout the party's history.

The themes of China’s local administrative hierarchy, and its historical evolution, have until now received scant attention; this book fills that gap, and presents a comprehensive survey of China’s local administration, from the province down to the township. It examines the political and functional definitions and historical origins of the nine local administrative levels or categories in contemporary China: the province, the centrally-administered municipality, the ethnic minority autonomous region, the special administrative region, the deputy-provincial city, the prefecture, the county, township and urban district. It investigates how each of the different levels of China’s local administration has developed historically, both before and after 1949; and it explores the functions, political and economic, that the different levels and units carry out, and how their relationships with superior and subordinate units have evolved over time. It also discusses how far the post-Mao reforms have affected local administration, and how the local administrative hierarchy is likely to develop going forward.","2009-10-16","2022-06-21 09:24:48","2022-06-21 09:24:48","","","238","","","","","China's Local Administration","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6nqMAgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=6nqMAgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Social Science / General; Political Science / World / Asian; Social Science / Regional Studies; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era examines how the structure and dynamics of party leadership have evolved since the late 1990s and argues that ""inner-party democracy""—the concept of collective leadership that emphasizes deal making based on accepted rules and norms—may pave the way for greater transformation within China's political system. Xi's legacy will largely depend on whether he encourages or obstructs this trend of political institutionalization in the governance of the world's most populous and increasingly pluralistic country.Cheng Li also addresses the recruitment and composition of the political elite, a central concern in Chinese politics. China analysts will benefit from the meticulously detailed biographical information of the 376 members of the 18th Central Committee, including tables and charts detailing their family background, education, occupation, career patterns, and mentor-patron ties.","2016-10-18","2022-06-21 09:23:32","2022-06-21 09:23:32","","","514","","","","","Chinese Politics in the Xi Jinping Era","","","","","Brookings Institution Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 3NKACwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=3NKACwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Geopolitics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a comparative historical approach, Wrestling with Democracy examines why voting systems have (or have not) changed in western industrialized countries over the past century.In this first single-volume study of voting system reform covering all western industrialized countries, Dennis Pilon reviews national efforts in this area over four timespans: the nineteenth century, the period around the First World War, the Cold War, and the 1990s. Pilon provocatively argues that voting system reform has been a part of larger struggles over defining democracy itself, highlighting previously overlooked episodes of reform and challenging widely held assumptions about institutional change.","2013-06-17","2022-06-22 11:12:26","2022-06-22 11:12:26","","","405","","","","","Wrestling with Democracy","","","","","University of Toronto Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: KYiBAAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=KYiBAAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / World; Political Science / World / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The committee was organized in late 1995 to respond to a growing need for prevention, management, and resolution of violent conflict in the international arena, a concern about the changing nature and context of such conflict in the post-Cold War era, and a recent expansion of knowledge in the field. The committee's main goal is to advance the practice of conflict resolution by using the methods and critical attitude of science to examine the effectiveness of various techniques and concepts that have been advanced for preventing, managing, and resolving international conflicts. The committee's research agenda has been designed to supplement the work of other groups, particularly the Carnegie Corporation of New York's Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, which issued its final report in December 1997. The committee has identified a number of specific techniques and concepts of current interest to policy practitioners and has asked leading specialists on each one to carefully review and analyze available knowledge and to summarize what is known about the conditions under which each is or is not effective. These papers present the results of their work.","1999-05-20","2022-06-22 11:02:26","2022-06-22 11:11:30","","","73","","","","","","","","","","National Academies Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Oiuf7g0rAHgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Oiuf7g0rAHgC","","Political Science / Security (National & International); History / Military / Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fifth-largest country and population in the world, with nearly one-half the inhabitants of Latin America, Brazil has the world’s ninth-richest economy. Given the nation’s size and influence, its capacity to achieve stable democracy and economic growth will have global impact. Understanding democracy in Brazil is therefore a crucial task, one which this book undertakes. Theoretically, the author argues that most party systems in the third wave of democratization, after 1974, have distinctive features that require us to reformulate theories about party systems generally; previous works have paid scant attention to the importance of variance in the degree of institutionalization of party systems. The author also argues that many third-wave cases underscore the need to focus on the capacity of the state and political elites to structure and restructure party systems from below. Empirically, the author studies the Brazilian party system and democratization, with particular reference to the 1979-96 period. He underscores the weakness of the party system and the resulting problems of democratization. He argues that the party system is poorly institutionalized, explores the reasons for the difficulties of party building, and addresses the consequences of weak institutionalization, which leads him to reaffirm the central significance of parties in the face of widespread skepticism about their importance.","1995","2022-06-22 11:07:38","2022-06-22 11:11:07","2022-06-22 11:07:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\2VPAUPMC\books.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It investigates how the length of democratic experience, the institutionalization of individual parties, the fragmentation of parliaments, and the support for anti-establishment parties, shape the degreeof institutionalization of party systems. The analyses presented answer the questions of whether predictability in partisan interactions is necessary for the survival of democratic regimes and whether it improves or undermines the quality of democracy. The developments of party politics at the elitelevel are contrasted with the dynamics of voting behaviour. The comparisons of distinct historical periods and of macro-regions provide a comprehensive picture of the European history of party competition and cooperation. The empirical overview presented in the book is based on a novel conceptual framework and features party composition data of more than a thousand European governments. Party systems are analysed in terms of poles and blocs, and the degree of closure and of polarization is related to a new partysystem typology. The book demonstrates that information collected from partisan interactions at the time of government formation can reveal changes that characterise the party system as a whole. The empirical results confirm that the Cold War period (1945-1989) was exceptionally stable, while the post-Berlin-Wall era shows signs of disintegration, although more at the level of voters than at the level of elites. After three decades of democratic politics in Europe (1990-2019), the West andthe South are looking increasingly like the East, especially in terms of the level of party de-institutionalization. The West and the South are becoming more polarised than the East, but in terms of parliamentary fragmentation, the party systems of the South and the East are converging, while theWest is diverging from the rest with its increasingly high number of parties. As far as our central concept, party system closure, is concerned, thanks to the gradual process of stabilization in the East, and the recent de-institutionalization in the West and South, the regional differences aredeclining.  Comparative Politics is a series for researchers, teachers, and students of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics.

In contrast to previous policies of repression towards labour unrest, these recent disputes centring round wages and working conditions have been met with a more permissive response on the part of the state, as the CCP ostensibly seeks to facilitate a transition away from a model of political economy based on ‘low-road’ labour relations and export dependence.  Labour and Development in East Asia shows that such inter-linkages between labour, geopolitical transformations, and states’ developmental strategies have been much more central to East Asia’s development than has commonly been recognised. By adopting an explanatory framework of the labour-geopolitics-development nexus, the book theorises and provides an historical analysis of the formation and transformation of the East Asian regional political economy from the end of the Second World War to the present, with particular reference to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. This book will be required reading for students and scholars of international relations, development studies and comparative politics.","2014-10-10","2022-06-22 11:07:00","2022-06-22 11:07:00","","","203","","","","","Labour and Development in East Asia","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: vwvEBAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=vwvEBAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Has regular electoral competition made a difference for the welfare of citizens?

Who votes for whom and why? Why has growing inequality in many parts of the world not led to renewed class-based conflicts, seeming instead to have come with the emergence of new divides over identity and integration? News analysts, scholars, and citizens interested in exploring those questions inevitably lack relevant data, in particular the kinds of data that establish historical and international context. Political Cleavages and Social Inequalities provides the missing empirical background, collecting and examining a treasure trove of information on the dynamics of polarization in modern democracies. The chapters draw on a unique set of surveys conducted between 1948 and 2020 in fifty countries on five continents, analyzing the links between votersÕ political preferences and socioeconomic characteristics, such as income, education, wealth, occupation, religion, ethnicity, age, and gender. This analysis sheds new light on how political movements succeed in coalescing multiple interests and identities in contemporary democracies. It also helps us understand the conditions under which conflicts over inequality become politically salient, as well as the similarities and constraints of voters supporting ethnonationalist politicians like Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro, Marine Le Pen, and Donald Trump. Bringing together cutting-edge data and historical analysis, editors Amory Gethin, Clara Martnez-Toledano, and Thomas Piketty offer a vital resource for understanding the voting patterns of the present and the likely sources of future political conflict.","2021-11-16","2022-06-22 11:05:06","2022-06-22 11:05:12","","","657","","","","","Political Cleavages and Social Inequalities","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: m2pCEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=m2pCEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / Political Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Korean society is becoming more polarized. Demands for ‘economic democratization’ and a fairer redistribution of wealth occupy centre-stage of political campaigns, debates and discourse. The contributions offer perspectives on this wide-ranging socio-political change by examining the transformation of organized labour, civil society, the emergence of new cleavages in society, and the growing ethnic diversity of Korea’s population. Bringing together a team of scholars on Korea’s transition and democratization, the story the books tells is one of a society acutely divided by the neo-liberal policies that accompanied and followed the Asian financial crisis. Taken together, the contributions argue that tackling inequalities are challenges that Korean policy-makers can no longer postpone. The solution, however, cannot be imposed, once again, from the top down, but needs to arise from a broader conversation including all segments of Korean society. The book is intended for a readership interested in South Korean politics specifically, and global experiences in transition more generally.","2017-09-06","2022-06-22 11:04:16","2022-06-22 11:04:16","","","312","","","","","Korea’s Quest for Economic Democratization","","","","","Springer","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wYM0DwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wYM0DwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / Globalization; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Political Economy; Political Science / Political Ideologies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Focusing on the Kim Dae-jung administration (1998-2003) as a case study in the failure of a government to turn electoral success into stable governability, or ability to implement reform policies, the book’s research draws on two bodies of literature which, though focusing on the same dependent variable (cabinet or government stability), have rarely been used in tandem: coalition research on parliamentary systems and studies of divided government in presidential systems.   Youngmi Kim argues that a weak institutionalization of the ruling party and the party-system accounts for political instability and inefficient governability in Korea and in doing so her study makes a number of key contributions to the field. Theoretically it proposes a framework which integrates a rationalist approach with one that acknowledges the role of political culture. It further enhances the understanding of factors affecting governability after coalition-building across regime types and aims to build on recent demands for broader cross-regime analysis of minority/divided government and of the determinants of governability. This has important comparative implications as coalition-building within (semi-) presidential systems has occurred in other post-authoritarian contexts. The book finally provides a new dataset which fills a gap in a field where Western cases constitute the main focus of research.  The Politics of Coalition in Korea will be of interest to students and scholars of Korean studies, Korean politics, Asian studies and Asian politics.   Youngmi Kim is Assistant Professor at the Departments of Public Policy, and International Relations and European Studies at Central European University, Budapest, Hungary.","2011-04-05","2022-06-22 11:03:41","2022-06-22 11:03:41","","","222","","","","","The Politics of Coalition in Korea","","","","","Taylor & Francis","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: gMsthiNzxLsC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=gMsthiNzxLsC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties; Political Science / World / Asian; Social Science / Regional Studies; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General; Political Science / American Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This divergence is all the more remarkable when considered in the light of the fact that the two Regions, commonly subject to oversight by China's authoritarian Party-state, possess constitutional frameworks that are nearly identical; feature similar hybrid regimes; and share a lot in history, ethnicity, culture, and language. Informed by political science and economics, this book breaks new ground by locating the cause of this anomaly, studied within the universe of authoritarian constitutionalism, not in the common law-civil law differences between these two former European dependencies, but the disparate levels of political transaction costs therein.","2019-04-25","2022-06-22 11:03:10","2022-06-22 11:03:18","","","301","","","","","Hybrid Constitutionalism","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Ql-LDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / General; Law / Constitutional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Plattner predicted that East Asia, with its remarkable diversity of political regimes, economies, and religions, would likely be the most critical arena in the global struggle for democracy, a prediction that has proven prescient. Although the recent political upheavals in the Middle East have understandably grabbed the world’s attention, there is reason to doubt whether the overthrow of some authoritarian regimes there will lead to the establishment of stable democracies any time soon. On the other hand, East Asia, the world’s most populous and economically dynamic region, already boasts several consolidated democracies and provides a fascinating laboratory for studies of both authoritarian resilience and the prospects for democratization. This updated volume, which features contributions by distinguished scholars in East Asian studies, will be welcomed by instructors and students in the field, particularly as U.S. foreign policy is in the process of undertaking a “pivot” toward Asia.Democracy in East Asia offers a comprehensive treatment of the political landscape in both Northeast and Southeast Asia, including discussions of China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Burma (Myanmar).

Who dominates in the contemporary policy process in South  Korea? How do policy advocates engage in advocacy activities to exercise  influence? Building on existing theories of state, society, and public policies  in democracies, Advocacy and Policymaking  in South Korea argues that the legacy of state-society relationships  explains who influences and how in South Korean policymaking. The state-society  relationship has been a popular framework to explain democratic transition and  consolidation. Yet, few studies to date extend the approach to explain advocacy  and policymaking across political systems. Jiso Yoon shows the relevance of the  framework in explaining advocacy and policymaking today with empirical evidence  drawn from the contemporary policy process in South Korea. In addition, she  compares policy communities across new and old democracies, such as South Korea  and the United States. In this regard, the comparative analysis included in the  book sets an important research example for students of comparative public  policy to follow.","2016-08-30","2022-06-22 10:59:58","2022-06-22 10:59:58","","","226","","","","","Advocacy and Policymaking in South Korea","","","","","SUNY Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: F8XvDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=F8XvDAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Political Advocacy; History / Asia / Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where much of the existing literature on the state-democracy nexus focuses on quantitative cross-national data, this volume offers a theoretically grounded regional analysis built around in-depth qualitative case studies. The chapters examine cases of successful democratic consolidation (South Korea, Taiwan), defective democracy (Philippines, Indonesia, East Timor), and autocratic reversal (Cambodia, Thailand). The book's evidence challenges the dominant 'state first, democracy later' argument, demonstrating instead that stateness is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for democratic consolidation. The authors not only show that democratization can become trapped in path-dependent processes, but also that the system-level organization of informal networks plays a key role in shaping the outcome of democratic transitions.","2020-05-21","2022-06-22 10:58:44","2022-06-22 10:58:44","","","293","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: YV3bDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=YV3bDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / General; Political Science / Political Process / General; Political Science / World / General; Law / Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

China, Japan and Russia represented at some moments modern threats, but also denoted a range of alternative modernity possibilities, and ultimately provided a model for Korea’s pre-colonial and colonial modernity. This book explores the way in which modern Korea perceived its geographic neighbours from the 1890s until 1945. It shows that Korea's modern nationalism was at the same time internationalist in its orientation, as the vision of Korea’s ideal place in the world and brighter national future was often linked to the examples (positive and negative), threats (perceived and real) and allies abroad. Exploring the importance of the international knowledge and experience for the formation of the Korean nationalist paradigms, it offers nuance to the existing picture of the international connections and environment of the Korean national movements. It shows that the picture of Japan inside the anti-Japanese independence movement of the colonial period was more complicated than simple hatred of the invaders: modern achievements of Japan were admired even by anti-colonial nationalists as a possible model for Korea. The book also demonstrates the extent to which Chinese and Soviet revolutions influenced the thinking of modern Korean intellectuals across the whole ideological spectrum.  Introducing new sources presented in English for the first time, and including themes such as race and ethnicity, global revolution, and gender, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of Korean, East Asian and Russian history, as well as historians of the colonial/modern era more generally.","2015-11-19","2022-06-22 10:28:06","2022-06-22 10:28:06","","","217","","","","","Modern Korea and Its Others","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: E474CgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=E474CgAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / Korea; Social Science / Regional Studies; History / Asia / General; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General; History / Modern / 20th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reevaluating the role of parties and committees, Gary Cox and Mathew McCubbins view parties in the House—especially majority parties—as a species of ""legislative cartel."" These cartels usurp the power, theoretically resident in the House, to make rules governing the structure and process of legislation. Possession of this rule-making power leads to two main consequences. First, the legislative process in general, and the committee system in particular, is stacked in favor of majority party interests. Second, because the majority party has all the structural advantages, the key players in most legislative deals are members of that party and the majority party's central agreements are facilitated by cartel rules and policed by the cartel's leadership.Debunking prevailing arguments about the weakening of congressional parties, Cox and McCubbins powerfully illuminate the ways in which parties exercise considerable discretion in organizing the House to carry out its work.This work will have an important impact on the study of American politics, and will greatly interest students of Congress, the presidency, and the political party system.","1993-04-05","2022-06-22 10:27:07","2022-06-22 10:27:20","","","348","","","","","Legislative Leviathan","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=g1rvz-UlK9wC","","History / United States / General; Political Science / American Government / Legislative Branch","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking a thematic approach to understanding South Korean democracy, each chapter in this textbook is written by a leading Korean expert on a different element of South Korean politics and government. Covering themes such as intergenerational differences, the instability of the party system, the role of the president, and the impact of the 2016 demonstrations, this is a vital and lively introduction to Korean politics. This systematic and nuanced approach helps you understand the past, present, and possible futures of South Korea’s democracy. It also helps in understanding South Korea’s system for the purposes of comparing it with other political systems.  The New Dynamics of Democracy in South Korea is an invaluable textbook for students of Korean politics, which will also be a useful resource for scholars of comparative democracy.","2021-06-29","2022-06-22 10:26:31","2022-06-22 10:26:31","","","239","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: vqYvEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=vqYvEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / American Government / National","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I use data from 2002-2010 U.S. House elections which provide for the placement of major party primary winners on the same ideological dimension as their primary, general election, and partisan donor constituencies. Using this unique data set, I find evidence that the influence of co-partisans and donors in primary elections, and the proliferation of safe congressional districts affect polarization in the United States by affecting the ideological position and electoral success of congressional candidates. In Chapter 1, I argue that ideologically extreme congressional candidates are able to win office because of the influence of co-partisans and donors in primary elections, and the proliferation of safe congressional districts. At the nomination stage, the threat of a primary drives congressional candidates to diverge from the general electorate to take ideological positions closer to their partisan constituencies. These ideologically extreme nominees are able to win the general election because of the lack of competitive congressional districts. While general elections serve as a moderating force, with few competitive districts the polarizing effects of primary elections dominate. As a result, major party nominees and members of Congress are extremely polarized along ideological lines. In Chapter 2, I discuss the data and measures I use to analyze polarization in modern American politics. I describe the method I use to construct comparable measures of ideology for major party House candidates and their primary, general election, and partisan donor constituencies. I validate these measures using other prominent measures of candidate ideology, and discuss potential issues that arise from the use of these measures. In Chapter 3, I examine the influence of primary, general election, and partisan donor constituencies on the ideological extremity of major party nominees relative to their primary and general election constituencies. In Chapter 4, I analyze the effect ideological positioning has on electoral success. I examine how ideological proximity to partisan constituencies affects success at the nomination stage, as well as how proximity to the district affects success in the general election. In Chapter 5, I examine the effect that state laws and primary election rules have on the ideological positioning of nominees for the House of Representatives. I analyze the effect that primary types, party conventions, and other primary rules have on the extent to which nominees diverge from their districts. I end with a concluding chapter that summarizes the most important findings of this work. I discuss the implications of these findings for the study of elections and representation in the United States, and identify several avenues of future research that stem from these findings.","2017","2022-06-22 10:26:12","2022-06-22 10:26:12","","","book","","","","","","","","","","University of California, Davis","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: yixptAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=yixptAEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In these environments, political factions fail to establish long-term connections with the electorate and thus regularly rise and fall from the political arena.  This book provides an organizational explanation for the variations in party-level electoral volatility. It looks comparatively at 29 political parties in six Central and Eastern European democracies between 1990 and 2008 to examine how political parties can influence their electoral environment. Using empirical evidence, Gherghina tests the effect of candidate selection procedures, membership organizations, and re-nomination of incumbent MPs on voters’ loyalty, and in doing so, demonstrates how party organization greatly affects electoral stability.   Including case studies from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia this book will be of interest to students and scholars of comparative politics, party politics, democratization, elections, and Central and Eastern European politics.","2014-10-17","2022-06-22 10:23:10","2022-06-22 10:23:10","","","215","","","","","Party Organization and Electoral Volatility in Central and Eastern Europe","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: HYPZBAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=HYPZBAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But despite unprecedented progress, there is growing dissatisfaction with the state of democracy and deepening mistrust of democratic institutions; a situation exacerbated by the economic crisis. Are Europe&#39;s democracies really under threat? Has the traditional model of European democracy exhausted its potential? A broad consensus is forming as to the urgent need to examine the origins of the crisis and to explore visions and strategies which could contribute to rebuilding confidence in democracy. As Europe&#39;s guardian of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, the Council of Europe is committed to exploring the state and practice of European democracy, as well as identifying new challenges and anticipating future trends. In order to facilitate this reflection, the Council of Europe held a series of Democracy Debates with the participation of renowned specialists working in a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. This publication presents the eight Democracy Debate lectures. Each presentation analyses a specific aspect of democracy today, placing the issues not only in their political context but also addressing the historical, technological and communication dimensions. The authors make proposals on ways to improve democratic governance and offer their predictions on how democracy in Europe may evolve. Together, the presentations contribute to improving our understanding of democracy today and to recognising the ways it could be protected and strengthened.","2012-01-01","2022-06-21 14:24:31","2022-06-22 09:59:30","","","112","","","","","Democracy on the Precipice","","","","","Council of Europe","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: VczvwYJzi08C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=VczvwYJzi08C","","Political Science / Political Freedom; Political Science / Public Affairs & Administration; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Law / Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An effective poverty reduction strategy process and a productive partnership can be built only on a platform of strong public capacity: capacity to formulate policies; capacity to build consensus; capacity to implement reform; and capacity to monitor results, learn lessons, and adapt accordingly. Building the requisite capacities turns out to be a formidable challenge. For these reasons, enhancing the capacity of African states has risen to the top of the continent's development agenda.In recent years, a number of African governments have moved forward with new-style programs to build public sector capacity. 'Building State Capacity in Africa' aims to share some of the lessons for the design and implementation of public sector capacity building that are emerging from this new generation of operational practice.

In Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, decades of colonial subjugation—most infamously under Belgium's Leopold II—were followed by decades of civil warfare that spilled into neighboring countries. When these conflicts lead to horrors such as the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ethnic difference and postcolonial legacies are commonly blamed, but, with so much at stake, such simple explanations cannot take the place of detailed, dispassionate analysis.The Dynamics of Violence in Central Africa provides a thorough exploration of the contemporary crises in the region. By focusing on the historical and social forces behind the cycles of bloodshed in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo-Kinshasa, René Lemarchand challenges much of the conventional wisdom about the roots of civil strife in former Belgian Africa. He offers telling insights into the appalling cycle of genocidal violence, ethnic strife, and civil war that has made the Great Lakes region of Central Africa the most violent on the continent, and he sheds new light on the dynamics of conflict in the region.Building on a full career of scholarship and fieldwork, Lemarchand's analysis breaks new ground in our understanding of the complex historical forces that continue to shape the destinies of one of Africa's most important regions.","2012-04-18","2022-06-22 09:56:08","2022-06-22 09:56:14","","","346","","","","","","","","","","University of Pennsylvania Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 9wrHbLDs5xgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=9wrHbLDs5xgC","","Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries; Social Science / Violence in Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why have some developing country states been more successful at facilitating industrialization than others? An answer to this question is developed by focusing both on patterns of state construction and patterns of state intervention aimed at promoting industrialization. Four countries are analyzed in detail - South Korea, Brazil, India, and Nigeria - over the twentieth century. The states in these countries varied from cohesive-capitalist (mainly in Korea), through fragmented-multiclass (mainly in India), to neo-patrimonial (mainly in Nigeria). It is argued that cohesive-capitalist states have been most effective at promoting industrialization and neo-patrimonial states the least. The performance of fragmented-multiclass states falls somewhere in the middle. After explaining in detail as to why this should be so, the study traces the origins of these different state types historically, emphasizing the role of different types of colonialisms in the process of state construction in the developing world.","2004-08-30","2022-06-22 09:54:48","2022-06-22 09:55:22","","","484","","","","","State-Directed Development","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=w_r7wLD--VoC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Political Science / Political Process / General; Political Science / Colonialism & Post-Colonialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"LSNF2ME5","book","1993","Hellman, Joel","Seize the State, Seize the Day: State Capture, Corruption and Influence in Transition","","","","","","The main challenge of the transition has been to redefine how the state interacts with firms, but little attention has been paid to the flip side of the relationship : how firms influence the state - especially how they exert influence on, and collude with public officials to extract advantages. Some firms in transition economies have been able to shape the rules of the game to their own advantage, at considerable social cost, creating what the authors call a ""capture economy"" in many countries. In the capture economy, public officials, and politicians privately sell under-provided public goods, and a range of rent-generating advantages ""a la carte"" to individual firms. The authors empirically investigate the dynamics of the capture economy, on the basis of new firm-level data from the 1999 Business Environment and enterprise performance survey (BEEPS), which permits the unbundling of corruption into meaningful, and measurable components. they contrast state capture (firms shaping, and affecting formulation of the rules of the game through private payments to public officials, and politicians) with influence (doing the same without recourse to payments), and with administrative corruption (""petty"" forms of bribery in connection with the implementation of laws, rules, and regulations). They develop economy-wide measures for these phenomena, which are then subject to empirical measurement utilizing the BEEPS data. State capture, influence, and administrative corruption are all shown to have distinct causes, and consequences. Large incumbent firms with formal ties to the state tend to inherit influence as a legacy of the past, and tend to enjoy more secure property, and contractual rights, and higher growth rates. To compete against these influential incumbents, new entrants turn to state capture as a strategic choice - not as a substitute for innovation, but to compensate for weaknesses in the legal, and regulatory framework. When the state under-provides the public goods needed for entry and competition, ""captor"" firms purchase directly from the state, such private benefits as secure property rights, and removal of obstacles to improved performance - but only in a capture economy. Consistent with empirical findings in previous research on petty corruption, administrative corruption - unlike both capture and influence - is not associated with specific benefits for the firm. The focus of reform should be shifted toward channeling firms' strategies in the direction of more legitimate forms of influence, involving societal ""voice"", transparency reform, political accountability, and economic competition, Where state capture has distorted reform to create (or preserve) monopolistic structures, supported by powerful political interests, the challenge is particularly daunting.","1993","2022-06-22 09:33:30","2022-06-22 09:48:18","","","book","","","","","Seize the State, Seize the Day","","","","","World Bank","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5kDjswEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=5kDjswEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He describes these countries as ""quasi-states,"" arguing that they exist more by the support and indulgence of the international community than by the abilities and efforts of their own governments and peoples. He investigates the international normative framework that upholds sovereign statehood in the Third World. This he calls ""negative sovereignty"" and contrasts it with what he sees as the ""positive sovereignty"" that emerged in Europe along with the modern state. Within this structure, he examines how negative sovereignty arose, and its mechanisms and consequences for both international politics and the domestic conditions of quasi-states.

"RKC7SL5T","book","1996","Peloso, Vincent; Tenenbaum, Barbara","Liberals, Politics, and Power: State Formation in Nineteenth-century Latin America","","978-0-8203-1800-4","","","","Looking at the Latin American liberal project during the century of postindependence, this collection of original essays draws attention to an underappreciated dilemma confronting liberals: idealistic visions and fiscal restraints. Liberals, Politics, and Power focuses on the inventiveness of nineteenth-century Latin Americans who applied liberal ideology to the founding and maintenance of new states. The impact of liberalism in Latin America, the contributors show, is best understood against the larger backdrop of struggles that pitted regional demands against the pressures of foreign finance, a powerful church against a decentralized state, and aristocratic desire to retain privilege against rising demands for social mobility. Moving beyond the traditional historiographical division between Eurocentric and dependency theories, the essays attempt to account for a uniquely Latin American liberal ideology and politics by exploring the political dynamics of such countries as Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Peru. Contributors discuss liberal efforts to build a viable legal order through elections and to implement a means of public finance that could fund the states' operations. Essays that span the entire century address issues such as the emergence of caudillos, the role of artisans, and popular participation in elections in light of fiscal, and other, impediments to progress. In their introduction, Vincent C. Peloso and Barbara A. Tenenbaum provide a hemispheric overview of liberalism that illustrates its similarities across Latin America. By exploring the liberal constitutional and economic order lying beneath apparently dictatorial states, this pathbreaking volume underlines the importance of fiscal policy in the fashioning of state power. Liberals, Politics, and Power serves not only as a guide to the liberal principles and practices that governed state formation in nineteenth-century Latin America but also as a means to evaluate the complex relationship between ideas and practical politics.","1996","2022-06-21 17:58:13","2022-06-22 09:48:06","","","324","","","","","Liberals, Politics, and Power","","","","","University of Georgia Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IQlliGpH4Z0C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=IQlliGpH4Z0C","","History / Latin America / General; History / Latin America / Mexico; History / Latin America / South America; History / Modern / 19th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Widely considered to be among the most influential historical figures of the twentieth century, Stalin continues to be a source of intense study. In the absence of a comprehensive compilation of periodical literature, the need for Joseph Stalin: An Annotated Bibliography of English Language Periodical Literature to 2005 is conspicuous. Ranging from editorials and news reports to academic articles, the more than 1,700 sources cited collectively cover the full range of his life, the various aspects of his leadership, and virtually all facets of the system and practices traditionally associated with his name. The coverage in this bibliography extends beyond the person of Stalin to include the subjects of Stalinism, the Stalinist system, the Stalin phenomenon, and those policies and practices of the Communist Party and Soviet state associated with him. This volume also provides a record of scholarly opinion on Stalin and sheds light on the evolution and current state of Stalinology. An effort has been made to list only those articles in which Stalin figures prominently, but, in some instances, articles have been included which do not center on Stalin but are worthy of listing for other reasons. The book is divided into fourteen main sections: General Studies and Overviews; Biographical Information and Psychological Assessments; The Revolutionary Movement, October Revolution and Civil War; Rise to Power; Politics; Economics; Society and Social Policy; Nationalism and Nationality Policy; Culture; Religion; Philosophy and Theory; Foreign Relations and International Communism; Military Affairs; and De-Stalinization. Including a subject index of several hundred headings and even greater number of subheadings, this comprehensive annotated bibliography should be of benefit to those individuals who, for the purpose of research or classroom instruction, are seeking sources of information on Stalin.","2007-07-25","2022-06-22 09:37:57","2022-06-22 09:46:08","","","1000","","","","","Joseph Stalin","","","","","Scarecrow Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: C_7Xh2euykoC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=C_7Xh2euykoC","","History / Reference; Literary Criticism / Russian & Former Soviet Union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"UTZ669H2","book","2008","Kaplan, Seth","Fixing Fragile States: A New Paradigm for Development: A New Paradigm for Development","","978-0-275-99829-5","","","","Fragile states are a menace. Their lawless environments spread instability across borders, provide havens for terrorists, threaten access to natural resources, and consign millions of people to poverty. But Western attempts to reform these benighted places have rarely made things better. Kaplan argues that to avoid revisiting the carnage and catastrophes seen in places like Iraq, Bosnia, and the Congo, the West needs to rethink its ideas on fragile states and start helping their peoples build governments and states that actually fit the local landscape. Fixing Fragile States lays bare the fatal flaws in current policies and explains why the only way to give these places a chance at peace and prosperity is to rethink how development really works. Flawed governance systems, not corrupt bureaucrats or armed militias, are the cancers that devour weak states. The cure, therefore, is not to send more aid or more peacekeepers but to redesign political, economic, and legal structures-to refashion them so they can leverage local traditions, overcome political fragmentation, expand governance capacities, and catalyze corporate investment.After dissecting the reasons why some states prosper and others sink into poverty and violence, Fixing Fragile States visits seven deeply dysfunctional places—including Pakistan, Bolivia, West Africa, and Syria—and explains how even the most desperate of them can be transformed.","2008-06-30","2022-06-22 09:43:06","2022-06-22 09:45:55","","","233","","","","","Fixing Fragile States","","","","","ABC-CLIO","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: H_OWqf3t9pEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=H_OWqf3t9pEC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"MZFUPWM4","book","2009","Zolberg, Aristide","A Nation by Design: immigration policy in the fashioning of America","","978-0-674-04546-0","","","","According to the national mythology, the United States has long opened its doors to people from across the globe, providing a port in a storm and opportunity for any who seek it. Yet the history of immigration to the United States is far different. Even before the xenophobic reaction against European and Asian immigrants in the late nineteenth century, social and economic interest groups worked to manipulate immigration policy to serve their needs. In A Nation by Design, Aristide Zolberg explores American immigration policy from the colonial period to the present, discussing how it has been used as a tool of nation building. A Nation by Design argues that the engineering of immigration policy has been prevalent since early American history. However, it has gone largely unnoticed since it took place primarily on the local and state levels, owing to constitutional limits on federal power during the slavery era. Zolberg profiles the vacillating currents of opinion on immigration throughout American history, examining separately the roles played by business interests, labor unions, ethnic lobbies, and nativist ideologues in shaping policy. He then examines how three different types of migration--legal migration, illegal migration to fill low-wage jobs, and asylum-seeking--are shaping contemporary arguments over immigration to the United States. A Nation by Design is a thorough, authoritative account of American immigration history and the political and social factors that brought it about. With rich detail and impeccable scholarship, Zolberg's book shows how America has struggled to shape the immigration process to construct the kind of population it desires.","2009-06-30","2022-06-21 17:29:36","2022-06-22 09:45:46","","","669","","","","","A Nation by Design","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ZcpEYQ-pG2YC","","Social Science / Emigration & Immigration; History / United States / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"DUGRBZFR","book","2012","Soest, Christian","How Does Neopatrimonialism Affect the African State? The Case of Tax Collection in Zambia","","","","","","Following the neopatrimonialism paradigm, it can be hypothesised that in African states informal politics of the rulers infringe on the collection of taxes and in turn reduce state revenues. This article tests this proposition for the case of Zambia. The main finding is that there is no linear correlation between a neopatrimonial system and the collection of taxes. Neopatrimonial continuity in the country is evidenced by three factors; the concentration of political power, the award of personal favours and the misuse of state resources. Despite this continuity, the revenue performance has increased considerably with the creation of the semi-autonomous Zambia Revenue Authority. This demonstrates that the effect of neopatrimonialism on public policy in the African state is highly context-specific and dependent on the interaction with additional variables. Donor pressure has been the most important in the Zambian case. In order to apply neopatrimonialism for further empirical work on public policy in the African state, these additional variables have to be incorporated into the analysis.","2012","2022-06-21 17:46:02","2022-06-22 09:45:34","","","30","","","","","How Does Neopatrimonialism Affect the African State?","","","","","SSRN","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Y_3AzgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Y_3AzgEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous studies have focused on the role of the larger (or super) power and how it manages its relationships with other states, or on how great or major powers challenge or balance the hegemonic state. Beyond Great Powers and Hegemons seeks to explain why weaker states follow more powerful global or regional states or tacitly or openly resist their goals, and how they navigate their relationships with the hegemon. The authors explore the interests, motivations, objectives, and strategies of these 'followers'—including whether they can and do challenge the policies and strategies or the core position of the hegemon. Through the analysis of both historical and contemporary cases that feature global and regional hegemons in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and South Asia, and that address a range of interest areas—from political, to economic and military—the book reveals the domestic and international factors that account for the motivations and actions of weaker states.","2012-03-28","2022-06-21 17:59:52","2022-06-22 09:45:28","","","274","","","","","Beyond Great Powers and Hegemons","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: gQl7mPWnHlAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=gQl7mPWnHlAC","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Poor management of the socio-economic challenges by Houphouët-Boigny’s successors produced disastrous political consequences, including unprecedented political violence, the first-ever successful military coup, and two civil wars, culminating in former President Laurent Gbagbo being sent to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague to stand trial for war crimes.This third edition of Historical Dictionary of Cote d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast) contains a chronology, an introduction, appendixes, and an extensive bibliography.

It sheds new light on established questions and addresses issues that have never before been raised in the study of Stalinism.  Stalinism constitutes one of the most striking and contentious phenomena of the twentieth century.

This collection of papers by an international cast of authors investigates a variety of major aspects of Stalinism. Significant new questions – like the role of private enterprise and violence in state-making – as well as some of the more established questions – like the number of Soviet citizens who died in the Second World War, whether agricultural collectivisation was genocidal, nationality policy, the politics of executive power, and the Leningrad affair – are addressed here in innovative and stimulating ways.

While the economic evidence is clear that secure property rights are a necessary condition for catalysing broad-based economic development, the governance process by which those rights are secured is less clear.

Through a combination of single country case studies, comparative case studies and regional comparisons, the book is unequivocal that good governance is paramount for improving the performance of land reform programmes. All attempts at moving towards more formal secure tenure require congruence with informal norms, beliefs and values, and a set of clear systems and processes to avoid corruption and unintended negative consequences.","2022-01-02","2022-06-22 09:39:10","2022-06-22 09:39:10","","","339","","","","","Land Tenure Challenges in Africa","","","","","Springer International Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ewSHzgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ewSHzgEACAAJ","","Political Science / Public Policy / General; Political Science / Political Process / General; Social Science / Human Geography; Science / Earth Sciences / Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we find that Russian 'oligarchs' do control a substantial part of the economy. While the relative weight of their firms in Russian economy is huge, they do not seem to be excessively large by the standards of the global economy where most of them are operating. The oligarchs seem to run their firms more efficiently than other Russian owners controlling for industry, region and size.","2005","2022-06-22 09:28:04","2022-06-22 09:28:04","","","book","","","","","","","","","","SSRN","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 2UbozgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=2UbozgEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ils soulignaient le rôle des "" petits "", des "" sans importance "", des "" en bas du bas "" dans l'invention de formes originales de l'Etat, alors même que prévalaient au sud du Sahara des situations autoritaires. Mais ils s'interdisaient aussi de postuler l'existence d'une "" culture populaire "", en reprenant à leur compte les critiques formulées à l'encontre de cette notion. Ils proposaient pour leur part une problématique de l'énonciation du politique, seule à même de restituer l'historicité du politique dans sa complexité et son ambivalence. Leurs analyses ont marqué le renouvellement des études africaines et ont reçu une large audience bien au-delà de ces dernières. Réunies en 1992 dans un volume qui fit date mais qui était épuisé depuis plusieurs années, elles sont aujourd'hui reprises, alors que de nombreux travaux redécouvrent la portée de l'approche du "" politique par le bas "" et la mettent en perspective avec les subaltern studies indiennes, l'Alltagsgeschichte allemande, la microstoria italienne ou l'historiographie marxiste anglaise. Dans cette nouvelle édition augmentée, une préface inédite montre en quoi elle demeure utile pour comprendre le monde contemporain en dehors des facilités de pensée. A condition de voir qu'elle n'a jamais prétendu être une "" école "", mais un simple état d'esprit, une forme d'hétérodoxie par rapport aux courants établis des sciences sociales, une expression de cynisme heuristique vis-à-vis des croyances et des convenances académiques ou politiques.","2008","2022-06-22 09:10:38","2022-06-22 09:10:38","","","230","","","","","","","","","","KARTHALA Editions","","fr","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: kBCOqkLr83QC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=kBCOqkLr83QC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is the first publication to look at the domestic politics of claiming countries in order to understand who supports the claims and why.   Drawing on analysis of articles published in national newspapers and archival documents and interviews with individuals involved in return claims, the book demonstrates that such claims are inherently political. Focusing on Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, the book analyses how return claims contribute to the strengthening of state-sponsored discourses on the nation; the policy formation process that leads to the formulation of return claims; and who the main actors of the claims are, including civil society individuals, experts, state authorities, and Indigenous communities. The book proposes explanations for why Latin American countries are interested in specific objects held in Western museums and why these claims have come to light over the past three decades.  The Return of Cultural Heritage to Latin America argues that return claims ought to be the object of public debate, allowing contemporary societies to address the legacy of colonialism. The book will be essential reading for scholars and students engaged in the study of museums and heritage, political science, history, anthropology, cultural policy, and Latin America.","2022-02-11","2022-06-21 17:59:11","2022-06-21 17:59:11","","","240","","","","","The Return of Cultural Heritage to Latin America","","","","","Taylor & Francis Limited","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: _EWazgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=_EWazgEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this region exhibits many similarities with the North American and European countries that have traditionally served as sources for generating public policy knowledge, Latin American countries are also different in many fundamental ways. As such, existing policy concepts and frameworks may not always be the most effective tools of analysis for this unique region. To fill this gap, Comparative Public Policy in Latin America offers guidelines for refining current theories to suit Latin America&#39;s contemporary institutional and socio-economic realities. The contributors accomplish this task by identifying the features of the region that shape public policy, including informal norms and practices, social inequality, and weak institutions.

It also establishes a link between colonialism and the continued agitation for restructuring the political arrangement of the country. The contributions offer various perspectives on how the forceful amalgamation of disparate units and diverse nationalities have undermined the realization of the development potential of Nigeria.The book is divided into two parts. The first part interrogates the political economy of colonialism and the implications of this on economic development in contemporary Nigeria. The second part examines nation-building, governance, and development in a postcolonial state. The failure of the postcolonial political elites to ensure inclusive governance has continued to foster centrifugal and centripetal forces that question the legitimacy of the state. The forces have deepened calls for secession, accentuated conflicts and predispose the country to possible disintegration. A new government approach is required that would ensure equal representation, access to power and equitable distribution of resources.","2021-10-30","2022-06-21 17:56:53","2022-06-21 17:56:53","","","396","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4Y5FEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4Y5FEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Political Economy; Political Science / Political Ideologies / General; Political Science / World / African","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite their usefulness in the analysis of interparty electoral competition and coalitional behavior, these models suffer from various theoretical and empirical limitations, and the conditions under which each model applies are not well specified. This article discusses the relationships between vote-seeking, office-seeking, and policy-seeking party behavior and develops a unified theory of the organizational and institutional factors that constrain party behavior in parliamentary democracies. Vote-seeking, office-seeking, and policy-seeking parties emerge as special cases of competitive party behavior under specific organizational and institutional conditions.","1997","2022-06-22 15:06:15","2022-06-22 15:07:06","","","436","","","","","Party Competition and Strategic Responses to Change in the Electoral Environment","","","","","University of Michigan","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: VeYeAQAAMAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=VeYeAQAAMAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on raw electoral data from 30 sub-Saharan African countries observed between 1966 and 2016, this text explores the causes and mechanisms of Party System Institutionalization (PSI) and its relationship with the processes of mobilization and democratization. Posing key theoretical and empirical questions in cross-regional comparison, it examines and reveals the defining properties of PSI, how they should be measured and under what conditions it varies. In doing so, it contributes with a new explanatory framework of party system development – that gives primacy to modes of transition, political institutions and party-citizen linkages – to further cross-regional comparisons among third-wave party systems.  This text will be of key interest to scholars and students of democratization, elections, and African politics, and more broadly to comparative politics.","2018-01-03","2022-06-22 15:05:41","2022-06-22 15:05:41","","","293","","","","","Party Systems in Young Democracies","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: qShFDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=qShFDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on insider insight and a new framework to understand and evaluate political branding, Labor's strategies are considered in two case studies. They tell of skilful use of comprehensive branding strategies and costly disregard of basic branding principles, of stunning success and shattering reversal.

Drawing upon a unique set of coordinated public opinion surveys conducted by the World Values Survey, this book provides a dramatically new image of the political cultures of East Asia. Most East Asian citizens have strong democratic aspirations, even in still autocratic nations. Most East Asians support liberal market reforms, even in nationswhere state socialism has been dominant. The books findings thus provide a new perspective on the political values of Asian publics. We demonstrate that the dramatic socioeconomic changes of the past several decades have transformed public opinion, altering many of the social norms traditionallyidentified with Asian values, and creating public support for further political and economic modernization of the region. Political culture in East Asia is not an impediment to change, but creates the potential for even greater democratization and marketization.Comparative Politics is a series for students and teachers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics.

Conventional political science wisdom assumes that democracy is impossible without political parties, because parties fulfil all the key functions of democratic governance. They nominate candidates, coordinate campaigns, aggregate interests, formulate and implement policy, and manage government power. When scholars first asserted the essential connection between parties and democracy, most of the world's democracies were parliamentary. Yet by the dawn of the twenty-first century, most democracies had directly elected presidents. David J. Samuels and Matthew S. Shugart provide a theoretical framework for analyzing variation in the relationships among presidents, parties, and prime ministers across the world's democracies, revealing the important ways that the separation of powers alters party organization and behavior - thereby changing the nature of democratic representation and accountability.","2010-05-17","2022-06-22 14:58:22","2022-06-22 14:58:22","","","311","","","","","Presidents, Parties, and Prime Ministers","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: PtQgsQzC080C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=PtQgsQzC080C","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although most countries south of the Sahara introduced multiparty systems more than a decade ago, much remains to be understood about the political parties active within these systems. General statements about African parties are common, but tend to lack support from systematic research. Among the least studied areas is African party organization - including such issues as how parties function and who decides what. One useful way of studying the power dynamics within political parties is to analyze how parliamentary candidates are selected. While a common theme in party research in established democracies, this is the first systematic study of the subject in Africa. This book analyzes the selection system used in recent elections in 31 parties in 17 African countries, while a closer study of Ghana offers more detailed information. It is found that the selection process in many political parties is significantly more decentralized than general theories about African parties would suggest. In sharp contrast to arguments about the stability of African elites, incumbent Members of Parliament are often very vulnerable to challenges from other aspirants in their parties. It is argued that the logic of clientelism plays an important role in explaining these findings.""","2004","2022-06-22 14:57:40","2022-07-01 04:07:29","","","334","","","","","The Heart and Soul of the Party","","","","","Almqvist & Wiksell","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JsmKAAAAMAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=JsmKAAAAMAAJ","","History / Africa / General; Political Science / American Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"QM6WYBFD","book","2022","Chiaramonte, Alessandro","The Deinstitutionalization of Western European Party Systems","","978-3-030-97978-2","","","","This book offers a systematic and far-reaching account of party system institutionalization in Western Europe. Drawing upon a wide array of data and through a comparison of 20 countries from the end of WWII to 2019 across three arenas of party competition (electoral, parliamentary, and governmental ones), the empirical analysis shows that, over the past decade, the level of institutionalization in the Western European party systems has dramatically declined compared with previous decades. Electoral, parliamentary, and in some cases governmental instability and unpredictability have reached record-high levels. Although the impact of the 2008 Great Recession has certainly worked as a catalyst, this process of de-institutionalization has been mainly driven by long-term factors, such as cleavage decline and length of democratic experience. Moreover, its consequences are relevant not only for the relationship between parties and voters, but also for the very quality of democracy, as party system deinstitutionalization causes a decline in the citizens satisfaction of the way democracy works and even an erosion of the objective democratic standards. In a nutshell, Western Europe, once seen as the land of stability and the cradle of democracy, may have become the land of party system deinstitutionalization and incipient democratic backsliding.

Vincenzo Emanuele is Assistant Professor of Political Science at Luiss Guido Carli in Rome, Italy.","2022","2022-06-22 14:55:56","2022-06-22 14:55:56","","","260","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5LVrEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=5LVrEAAAQBAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Democracies in Development -- published in cooperation with the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance -- makes it clear that a legitimate and effective democracy is also essential for sustainable economic and social development. The book analyzes the effects of institutions on democratic systems, identifies regional trends in democratic reform, and assesses efforts to enhance governance. Chapters focus on the quality of democratic politics; citizen support for democracy and electoral participation; presidential democracy; political party systems; the balance of power between the executive and legislature; the authority of accountability agencies; and mechanisms to facilitate more direct citizen participation. Appendices outline the institutional structures of the region's democracies and examine voter turnout since 1978.

It shares one troubling problem with many other countries in recent years: the visible increase of extreme polarization in the language and emotions of political topics. However, Korea has experienced this problem much earlier. The history created weak parties that use deeply effective but harmful stories. This combination creates a downwards spiral where the performance of moral superiority becomes the sharpest weapon. The author points out that we need a standard for viewing this growing problem and argues that the traits of polarization in language are not well understood. Using partisan newspaper text data from 1990 to 2014 and quantitative text analysis, this book collects the most typical emotions and topics used by parties and partisans, analyzing why they exist. In the age of digital data and possibly restricted mobility, this book is a proposal for what the author calls “Computational Area Studies” and “Distant Fieldwork.”","2021-04-21","2022-06-22 14:53:14","2022-06-22 14:53:14","","","187","","","","","Polarized Politics in South Korea","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wxwoEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wxwoEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Political Process / Media & Internet; Social Science / Media Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He examines the American power structure as it has developed in the 1980s. He presents systematic, empirical evidence that a fixed group of privileged people dominates the American economy and government. The book demonstrates that an upper class comprising only one-half of one percent of the population occupies key positions within the corporate community. It shows how leaders within this ""power elite"" reach government and dominate it through processes of special-interest lobbying, policy planning and candidate selection. It is written not to promote any political ideology, but to analyze our society with accuracy.","1986","2022-06-25 05:17:38","2022-06-25 05:17:38","","","244","","","","","Who Rules America Now?","","","","","Simon & Schuster","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: bUS7AAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=bUS7AAAAIAAJ","","Social Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"DNCES2NK","book","2017","Dalton, Melville","Men Who Manage: Fusions of Feeling and Theory in Administration","","978-1-351-50580-2","","","","This is a classic study of how managers interpret and engage problems as they are experienced and felt at various points and levels in factories and businesses. Melville Dalton, drawing on ethnographic data, examines both positive and negative interactions among managers, between managers and between workers, and managers and firms. He discusses the consequences for each group that result from their interactions. Where relevance and data allow, Dalton relates his findings to the surrounding community.Dalton argues that the recurring problem areas in management grow out of six main areas: pressures for economy of operation; ""cooperation"" of officially powerless experts with their administrative superiors; local conflicts between union and management; uncertainty about the route to a place in middle and upper management; the task of recognizing and rewarding differential contributions; and the moral conflicts of the individual executive. Each of these six problem areas is made the subject of a chapter.What emerges is a study of compromises among key individuals and groups in business organizations, and of the strictures on compromise. The book offers insights into how workplace rules, in practice, move from being sacred guides to flexible tools to balance company goals and personal ends. This volume includes a new introduction by David Shulman detailing the importance of this work more than forty years after its original publication. It is part of Transaction's Organization and Business series.","2017-07-12","2022-06-25 05:15:55","2022-06-25 05:15:55","","","342","","","","","Men Who Manage","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wR0uDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wR0uDwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / General; Business & Economics / Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"HIKMF5WU","book","2016","Dark","The Waves of Time: Long-Term Change and International Relations","","978-1-4742-8831-6","","","","Since the end of the Cold War, analysts of international politics have given much greater attention to issues of change. It has become increasingly clear to specialists from many fields that any understanding of large-scale political change must encompass far longer timescales than has been usual in the study of world politics, and must incorporate multi-disciplinary perspectives. This book evaluates and draws on relevant theoretical approaches from other disciplines such as sociology, economics, geography, history, anthropology and archaeology, as well as evolutionary theory and the mathematical study of complexity. Using an epistemological framework, Dark sets out a theory of long-term world political change: the theory of 'Macrodynamics'. This is then applied to historical, anthropological and archaeological data to explain the changing forms of political organization, from the earliest human societies to the late twentieth century. The resulting analysis is a reinterpretation of the processes of global political change in the past and present. This, in turn, opens new areas of enquiry in the study of international relations and has profound implications for how we understand the changing world of today.","2016-10-06","2022-06-25 05:14:59","2022-07-04 04:13:03","","","306","","","","","The Waves of Time","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: t3DqDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=t3DqDAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships that were derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour. Although it is derived from the Latin word feodum or feudum (fief),which was used during the Medieval period, the term feudalism and the system which it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system by the people who lived during the Middle Ages.The classic definition, by François Louis Ganshof (1944), describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations which existed among the warrior nobility and revolved around the three key concepts of lords, vassals, and fiefs.","1965","2022-06-25 05:13:03","2022-06-25 05:14:18","","","464","","","","","","","","","","Archon Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 8HtCAAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=8HtCAAAAIAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"SEGNUSQ2","book","1987","Connolly, William E.","Politics and Ambiguity","","978-0-299-10994-3","","","","In a series of stimulating essays, William E. Connolly explores the element of ambiguity in politics. He argues that democratic politics in a modern society requires, if it is to flourish, an appreciation of the ambiguous character of the standards and principles we cherish the most. Connolly's work, lucidly, presented and intellectually challenging, will be of interest to students and scholars of political science, philosophy, rhetoric, and law, and to all whose interests include the connections between contemporary epistemological arguments and politics and, more broadly, between thought and language. Connolly criticizes the ways in which contemporary politics extends normalization into various areas of modern existence. He argues, against this trend, for an approach that would provide relief from the rigid identity formations that result from normalization. In supporting his thesis, Connolly shows how the imperative for growth must be relaxed if normalizing pressures are to be obviated. His, however, is not the familiar antigrowth argument; rather, he ties his thesis to his general antinormalization argument, asking how one could create an ethic that would sustain itself when the growth imperatives are relaxed. Connolly's chapters on the work of other thinkers (including Michel Foucault, Jürgen Habermas, Richard Rorty, and Charles Taylor) are linked with his main theme, as he shows how various tendencies in the philosophy of the social sciences and in political theory aid and abed the normalizing tendency. His analyses of Rorty and Taylor are especially important. Connolly shows the significance of antifoundationalism (Rorty's contribution to the debate on epistemology), while providing a compelling critique both of Rorty's stance and Taylor's alternative to it. Especially important to Connolly's thesis is the ontology on which it rests. He shows how the endorsement of an ontology of discordance within concord--a view that all systems of meaning impose order on that which was not designed to fit neatly within them--can support a more democratizing process. His final chapter, ""Where the Word Breaks Off,"" vindicates the ontology of discordance, which has governed the argument throughout the text. Throughout these essays, Connolly builds a consistent argument for the politicalization of normalization, disclosing forms of normalization where others have seen unproblematic modes of communication and problem solving. Original in concept and bold in presentation, Connolly's work will form the basis for considerable debate in the several disciplines it serves.","1987","2022-06-25 05:12:20","2022-06-25 05:12:20","","","188","","","","","","","","","","Univ of Wisconsin Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: d7dK3VG0y3gC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=d7dK3VG0y3gC","","Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How does the mind work? Does cognitive science explain all the mysteries of the brain? This collection of fourteen original essays from some of the top sociologists in the country, including Eviatar Zerubavel, Diane Vaughan, Paul Dimaggio and Gary Alan Fine, among others, opens a dialogue between cognitive science and cultural sociology, encouraging a new network of scientific collaboration and stimulating new lines of social scientific research. Rather than considering thought as just an individual act, Culture in Mind considers it in a social and cultural context. Provocatively, this suggests that our thoughts do not function in a vacuum: our minds are not alone. Covering such diverse topics as the nature of evil, the process of storytelling, defining mental illness, and the conceptualizing of the premature baby, these essays offer fresh insights into the functioning of the mind. Leaving the MRI behind, Culture in Mind will uncover the mysteries of how we think.","2013-05-13","2022-06-25 05:11:43","2022-06-25 05:11:43","","","468","","","","","Culture in Mind","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: e68KvQsjTnQC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=e68KvQsjTnQC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on theories and techniques from psychology, it focuses on the content analysis of judgments and uses a novel methodology to reveal the values that underpin decision making. The book centres on cases which divide judicial opinion: Dworkin's hard cases 'in which the result is not clearly dictated by statute or precedent'. In hard cases, there is real uncertainty about the legal rules that should be applied, and factors beyond traditional legal sources may influence the decision-making process. It is in these uncertain cases – where legal developments can rest on a single judicial decision – that values are revealed in the judgments. The findings in this book have significant implications for developments in law, judicial decision making and the appointment of the judiciary.","2020-02-20","2022-06-25 05:07:27","2022-06-25 05:07:27","","","231","","","","","Values in the Supreme Court","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 2PbKDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=2PbKDwAAQBAJ","","Law / Constitutional; Law / Judicial Power; Law / Public","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The principal perspectives are those afforded by the Interaction Hypothesis, Socio-Cultural Theory and the Levels of Processing model. Interaction is, therefore, defined broadly; it is seen as involving both intermental and intramental activity. The theoretical perspectives are explored empirically in a series of studies which investigate the relationship between aspects of interaction and second language acquisition. A number of these studies consider the effects of interaction on the acquisition of vocabulary (word meanings) by both adult and child L2 learners. In addition, the effects of language aptitude on input processing are considered. Further studies consider the contribution that interaction makes to the acquisition of grammatical knowledge. These studies provide clear evidence that social and intermental interaction are major forces in the acquisition of an L2. Finally, the book, considers a number of pedagogic specifications. In particular, the importance of discourse control as a means of learners' obtaining the quality of interaction likely to foster acquisition is discussed.","1999-01-01","2022-06-25 05:06:41","2022-06-25 05:06:41","","","298","","","","","","","","","","John Benjamins Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ku01oL286-MC","","Language Arts & Disciplines / Linguistics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"4ZMAAHEU","book","1994","Solingen, Etel","Scientists and the State: Domestic Structures and the International Context","","978-0-472-10486-4","","","","The book examines state/scientist relations in a wide range of twentieth-century states. The chapters respond to a common conceptual framework that explores the influence of domestic and international, political and economic structures on state/scientist relations. Case studies include the United States, the former Soviet Union, Japan, Germany (from Weimar to the reunification), France, Israel, Brazil, China, and India.  The rich literature on science, technology, and society has, for the most part, ignored the systematic study of political relations between scientific communities and the state, despite the unprecedented growth of these communities in the latter part of this century. This volume is designed to fill the gap by providing a comparative framework as well as historical case studies. The recent transformation of cold war structure, the exigencies of economic conversion and competitiveness, and the new waves of scientific migration bring the timeliness of this effort into sharp relief.  The application of a unifying conceptual framework to a varied set of instances broadens the volume's appeal to students of science, technology, and international relations, to researchers of the politics and history of science and technology, to scholars and practitioners of science policy, to natural scientists interested in the social and political context of scientific research, and to the general reader interested in the many ways in which states exploit scientific knowledge as a venue to power and wealth.","1994","2022-06-25 05:05:07","2022-06-25 05:05:07","","","280","","","","","Scientists and the State","","","","","University of Michigan Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=t-rIqu9f148C","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What kinds of competence are claimed by the bureaucrats and technocrats who govern us? And how do those who govern gain our recognition and acquiescence?  Bourdieu examines in detail the work of consecration that is carried out by elite education systemsin France by the grande écoles, in the United States by the Ivy League schools, and in England by Oxford and Cambridge. Today, this &quot;state nobility&quot; has at its disposal an unprecedented range of powers and distinctive titles to justify its privilege. Bourdieu shows how it is the heirstructural and sometimes genealogicalof the noblesse de robe, which, in order to consolidate its position in relation to other forms of power, had to construct the modern state and the republican myths, meritocracy, and civil service that went along with it.  Combining ethnographic description, historical documentation, statistical analysis, and theoretical argument, Bourdieu develops a wide-ranging and highly original account of the forms of power and governance that have come to prevail in our society today.","1998","2022-06-25 04:52:57","2022-06-25 04:52:57","","","510","","","","","The State Nobility","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=do9o-jIrzXgC","","Political Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing upon the history of literature and art from the mid-nineteenth century to the present, Bourdieu develops an original theory of art conceived as an autonomous value. He argues powerfully against those who refuse to acknowledge the interconnection between art and the structures of social relations within which it is produced and received. As Bourdieu shows, arts new autonomy is one such structure, which complicates but does not eliminate the interconnection.  The literary universe as we know it today took shape in the nineteenth century as a space set apart from the approved academies of the state. No one could any longer dictate what ought to be written or decree the canons of good taste. Recognition and consecration were produced in and through the struggle in which writers, critics, and publishers confronted one another.","1996","2022-06-25 04:50:38","2022-06-25 04:50:38","","","436","","","","","The Rules of Art","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5cgxLnbZjhcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=5cgxLnbZjhcC","","Literary Criticism / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This analysis of the provincial reality of absolutism argues that the answers to these questions lie in the relationship between the regional aristocracy and the crown. Starting with a critical examination of current approaches to state and society by institutional, social ""Annales,"" and Marxist historians, the author calls for a new class analysis based on the findings of all these schools.","1985","2022-06-25 04:16:01","2022-06-25 04:16:01","","","400","","","","","Absolutism and Society in Seventeenth-Century France","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=C-gtvGjSPTMC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Europe / General; History / Europe / Renaissance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This opposition, referred to as markedness, is one of the concepts which both Chomskyan generative grammar and Jakobsonian structuralism appear to share, yet which each tradition has treated differently. Battistella studies the historical development of the concept of markedness in the Prague School structuralism of Roman Jakobson, its importation into generative linguistics, and its subsequent development within Chomsky's ""principles and parameters"" framework. He traces how structuralist and generative linguistics have drawn on and expanded the notion of markedness, both as a means of characterizing linguistic constructs and as a theory of the innate language faculty.","1996-08-22","2022-06-25 04:03:18","2022-06-25 04:03:18","","","188","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: SEvM2fEEbA0C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=SEvM2fEEbA0C","","Language Arts & Disciplines / Linguistics / General; Foreign Language Study / English as a Second Language","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chapters on predictability and chance deal with lack of 6rder, with phenomena that appear meaningless or absurd from a point of view very prevalent in modern life.

To be sure, all wars have features in common - people are killed and property is destroyed - but in their origin wars are likely to be at least as different as the social structures from which they arise. Consequently, it is unlikely that there can be a simple theory of the causes of war or the maintenance of peace. The fact that wars are historical events need not discourage us. On the contrary, we should focus our understanding of the dimensions of each conflict, or classes of conflict, on the conjuncture of causes at hand. It follows that the study of conflict must be an interdisciplinary one.

The text also contains some useful information. Otherwise, there is not much to be said for it. The sad thing is that the author had an interesting idea to develop. His claim is that the British and not the French have been most dogmatic in their response to local government, and that as a result their capacity for problem-solving has been much reduced. Despite appearances, he implies, local democracy in Britain is in worse shape than in France. The argument essentially is that the French system allows for-indeed encourages-strong local input into national policy-making, whereas the British insulates the national government from local influence. The much vaunted autonomy of the British local authorities, combined with their size and strength and the breadth of their functional responsibilities, has actually become a source of weakness. Since the national government insists on its own autonomy, and the local authorities have to be controlled for various purposes, local government has become subject to arbitrary and capricious policy changes, which may completely disrupt its operations. The cutbacks imposed by the present Conservative government are an example. By contrast, local government in France is integrated into the national political and administrative system, and local politicians are necessarily involved in national policy-making. The cumul des mandats which brings the maire into national politics is a consequence of central control over local affairs, but the effect is to force the national government to adjust to local interests. It simply cannot act as arbitrarily as its British counterpart","1982","2022-06-25 03:48:02","2022-06-25 03:56:14","","","406","","","","","British Dogmatism and French Pragmatism","","","","","G.

In these lectures, Bourdieu sets out to define and defend sociology as an intellectual discipline; in doing so he introduces and clarifies all the key concepts for which he has become so well known, concepts that continue to shape the way that sociology is practised today. In this volume, Bourdieu focuses on one of these key concepts, capital, which forms part of the trilogy of concepts – habitus, capital, field – that define the core of his theoretical approach. A field, as a social space of relatively durable relations between agents and institutions, is also a site of specific investments, which presupposes the possession of specific forms of capital and secures both material and symbolic profits. While there are many different forms of capital, two are fundamental and effective in all social fields: economic capital and cultural capital. These and other forms of capital exist only in relation to the fields in which they are deployed: the distribution of the forms and quantities of capital constitutes the structure of the field within which agents act and they confer power over the field, over the mechanisms that define the functioning of the field and over the profits engendered in the field – over, for example, the transmission of cultural capital in the educational system. An ideal introduction to one of Bourdieu’s most important concepts, this volume will be of great interest to the many students and scholars who study and use Bourdieu’s work across the social sciences and humanities, and to general readers who want to know more about the work of one of the most important sociologists and social thinkers of the twentieth century.","2021-07-19","2022-06-25 03:43:05","2022-06-25 03:43:05","","","450","","","","","Forms of Capital","","","","","Wiley","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: T7nTzQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=T7nTzQEACAAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why didn’t Italy develop into an Absolutist state in the same, indigenous way as the other dominant Western countries, namely Spain, France and England? On the other hand, how did Eastern European countries develop into Absolutist states similar to those of the West, when their social conditions diverged so drastically? Reflecting on examples in Islamic and East Asian history, as well as the Ottoman Empire, Anderson concludes by elucidating the particular role of European development within universal history.","2013-03-12","2022-06-25 03:41:09","2022-06-25 03:41:09","","","575","","","","","","","","","","Verso Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: yjXVdMol61sC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=yjXVdMol61sC","","History / Europe / General; History / Civilization; Philosophy / History & Surveys / Medieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Alle Herausgeber, die der Reihe und diejenigen der einzelnen Bände, wie auch alle Autoren, die in den Handbüchern ein Thema bearbeiten, tragen dazu bei, dieses Ziel zu verwirklichen. Veröffentlichungssprache ist Englisch.  Wenngleich als Hauptzweck der Handbuchreihe die angemessene Darstellung des derzeitigen Wissensstandes in den durch die jeweiligen Handbuchbände abgedeckten Ausschnitten der Sprach- und Kommunikationswissenschaft zu gelten hat, so wird doch bei der Abgrenzung der wissenschaftlichen Bereiche, die jeweils in einem Handbuchband erschlossen werden sollen, keine starre Systematik vorausgesetzt. Die Reihe ist offen; die geschichtliche Entwicklung kann berücksichtigt werden. Diese Konzeption sowie die Notwendigkeit, dass zur gründlichen Vorbereitung jedes Bandes genügend Zeit zur Verfügung steht, führen dazu, dass die ganze Reihe in loser Erscheinungsfolge ihrer Bände vervollständigt werden kann. Jeder Band ist ein in sich abgeschlossenes Werk.  Die Reihenfolge der Handbuchbände stellt keine Gewichtung der Bereiche dar, sondern hat sich durch die Art der Organisation ergeben: die Herausgeber der Reihe bemühen sich, eine Kollegin oder einen Kollegen für die Herausgabe eines Handbuchbandes zu gewinnen. Hat diese/r zugesagt, so ist sie/er in der Wahl der Mitherausgeber und bei der Einladung der Autoren vollkommen frei. Die Herausgeber eines Bandes planen einen Band inhaltlich unabhängig und werden dabei lediglich an bestimmte Prinzipien für den Aufbau und die Abfassung gebunden; nur wo es um die Abgrenzung zu anderen Bänden geht, sind die Reihenherausgeber inhaltlich beteiligt. Dabei wird davon ausgegangen, dass mit dieser Organisationsform der Hauptzweck dieser Handbuchreihe, nämlich die angemessene Darstellung des derzeitigen Problem- und Wissensstandes in den durch die jeweiligen Handbuchbände abgedeckten Teilbereichen, am besten verwirklicht werden kann.","1993","2022-06-25 03:35:53","2022-06-25 03:35:53","","","636","","","","","","","","","","Walter de Gruyter","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5wwM8HAMvvEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=5wwM8HAMvvEC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Chaos of Disciplines reconsiders how knowledge actually changes and advances. Challenging the accepted belief that social sciences are in a perpetual state of progress, Abbott contends that disciplines instead cycle around an inevitable pattern of core principles. New schools of thought, then, are less a reaction to an established order than they are a reinvention of fundamental concepts. Chaos of Disciplines uses fractals to explain the patterns of disciplines, and then applies them to key debates that surround the social sciences. Abbott argues that knowledge in different disciplines is organized by common oppositions that function at any level of theoretical or methodological scale. Opposing perspectives of thought and method, then, in fields ranging from history, sociology, and literature, are to the contrary, radically similar; much like fractals, they are each mutual reflections of their own distinctions.","2010-07-15","2022-06-25 03:35:26","2022-06-25 03:35:26","","","276","","","","","","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=-H8vkDOrzCQC","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What are the preconditions from which schools arise? Do they exist as rigid rules or as flexible structures? How do they emerge from the day-to-day activities of academic life such as editing journals and writing papers?  Abbott analyzes the shifts in social scientific inquiry and discloses the intellectual rivalry and faculty politics that characterized different stages of the Chicago School. Along the way, he traces the rich history of the discipline's main journal, the American Journal of Sociology.  Embedded in this analysis of the school and its practices is a broader theoretical argument, which Abbott uses to redefine social objects as a sequence of interconnected events rather than as fixed entities. Abbott's theories grow directly out of the Chicago School's insistence that social life be located in time and place, a tradition that has been at the heart of the school since its founding one hundred years ago.","2017-05-19","2022-06-25 03:34:55","2022-06-25 03:34:55","","","262","","","","","Department and Discipline","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: WjfnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=WjfnDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Education / Higher; Education / History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where and why did groups such as law and medicine achieve their power? Will professionalism spread throughout the occupational world? While most inquiries in this field study one profession at a time, Abbott here considers the system of professions as a whole. Through comparative and historical study of the professions in nineteenth- and twentieth-century England, France, and America, Abbott builds a general theory of how and why professionals evolve.","2014-02-07","2022-06-25 03:32:03","2022-06-25 03:32:03","","","453","","","","","The System of Professions","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: WWzRAgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=WWzRAgAAQBAJ","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this, the number of HSWs is growing fast as governments strive to combat illness and address social care issues in a world of finite resources. This original collection analyses the global experience of HSWs in the UK, Japan, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Portugal, Sweden and The Netherlands. Leading academics examine issues including the interface of HSWs with the health professions, regulatory practice risks, employment challenges and the dilemmas of an ageing population. Crucial future policy recommendations are also made for a world becoming increasingly dependent on HSWs.","2020-07-23","2022-06-25 03:13:56","2022-06-25 03:13:56","","","290","","","","","Support Workers and the Health Professions in International Perspective","","","","","Policy Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 1JzyDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=1JzyDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Medical / Health Care Delivery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So why cooperate? In The Evolution of Cooperation, political scientist Robert Axelrod seeks to answer this question. In 1980, he organized the famed Computer Prisoners Dilemma Tournament, which sought to find the optimal strategy for survival in a particular game. Over and over, the simplest strategy, a cooperative program called Tit for Tat, shut out the competition. In other words, cooperation, not unfettered competition, turns out to be our best chance for survival.A vital book for leaders and decision makers, The Evolution of Cooperation reveals how cooperative principles help us think better about everything from military strategy, to political elections, to family dynamics.","2006-12-05","2022-06-25 07:39:34","2022-06-25 07:39:34","","","264","","","","","The Evolution of Cooperation","","","","","Basic Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: GxiKtAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=GxiKtAEACAAJ","","Political Science / General; History / Military / Strategy; Psychology / Social Psychology; Business & Economics / Decision-Making & Problem Solving; Mathematics / Game Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first wave rose in the wake of the Oil Crisis in 1972. The second was ignited by the Collapse of Communism in 1989, spiking with the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The third began to emerge after the Financial Crisis of 2008, soaring with the Refugee Crisis of 2015. Whether the Coronavirus Crisis of 2020 will lead to the rise of a fourth wave remains to be seen. The book traces a move away from liberal democracy and towards renewed authoritative tendencies on both sides of the Atlantic. It follows the mainstreaming of formerly discredited and marginalized politics, gradually becoming a new normal. By identifying common qualities of Neo-Nationalism, the book frames a threefold claim of nativist populists in protecting the people: discursively creating an external threat, pointing to domestic traitors, and positioning themselves as the true defenders of the nation.","2020-05-23","2022-06-25 07:39:08","2022-06-25 07:39:08","","","244","","","","","Neo-Nationalism","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: dDTnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=dDTnDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Political Science / World / European; Political Science / American Government / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Cultural Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors propose creation of a First Nations Property Ownership Act that would make it possible for First Nations to take over full ownership of reserve lands from the Crown, arguing that permitting private property on reserves would provide increased economic advantages.

This is the first comprehensive study of the political and military aspects of the early years of the war, the twenty-one-year period commencing with the battle of Ayn Jalut in Palestine in 1260 and ending in 1281 at the battle of Homs in northern Syria. Between these major confrontations, which resulted from Mongol invasions into Syria, the Mamluk-Ilkhanid struggle was continued in the manner of a 'cold war' with both sides involved in border skirmishes, diplomatic maneuvers, psychological warfare, ideological posturing, espionage and other forms of subterfuge. Here, as in the decisive battles, the Mamluks usually maintained the upper hand, establishing themselves as the major Muslim power at the time. Using primarily contemporary Arabic and Persian sources, Reuven Amitai-Preiss sheds new light on the confrontation, examining the war within the context of Ilkhanid/Mamluk relations with the Byzantine Empire, the Latin West and the crusading states, as well as with other Mongol states.","1995-02-02","2022-06-25 07:38:06","2022-06-25 07:38:16","","","292","","","","","Mongols and Mamluks","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=DFO-eV9cQ0sC","","History / Europe / Medieval; History / Asia / General; History / Middle East / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such conditions cannot be created ex abrubto, but must somehow evolve. What needs to develop is not only suitable practices and rules themselves, but also the public agencies and moral environment without which generalized trust is difficult to establish. The cultural endowment of societies as they have developed over their particular histories is bound to play a major role in this regard, and the matter of cultual endowment is one of the central themes of this book.On the other hand, division of labour does not only require well-enforced property rights and trust in economic dealings. It is also critically conditioned by the thickness of economic space, itself dependent on population density. This provides the second major theme of the volume: market development, including the development of private property rights is not possible, or will remain very incomplete, if populations are thinly spread over large areas of land. The book makes special reference to sub-Saharan Africa.","2015-12-08","2022-06-25 07:37:17","2022-06-25 07:37:17","","","409","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: YgseCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=YgseCwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Business & Economics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evolutionary psychology is currently advancing our understanding of altruism, moral behavior, family violence, sexual aggression, warfare, aesthetics, the nature of language, and gender differences in mate choice and perception. It is helping us understand the relationships between cognitive science, developmental psychology, behavior genetics, personality, and social psychology. Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology provides an up-to-date review of the ideas, issues, and applications of contemporary evolutionary psychology. It is suitable for senior undergraduates, first year graduate students, or professionals who wish to become conversant with the major issues currently shaping the emergence of this dynamic new field. It will be interesting to psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, economists, philosophers, cognitive scientists, and anyone interested in using new developments in the theory of evolution to gain new insights into human behavior.","2012-10-12","2022-06-25 07:36:47","2022-06-25 07:36:47","","","1279","","","","","","","","","","Psychology Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: l9eFste7qkcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=l9eFste7qkcC","","Psychology / General; Psychology / Experimental Psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UAS2PRLQ","book","2014","Manne, Geoffrey A.; Zywicki, Todd J.","Uncertainty, Evolution, and Behavioral Economic Theory","","","","","","Armen Alchian was one of the great economists of the twentieth century, and his 1950 paper, Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory, one of the most important contributions to the economic literature. Anticipating modern behavioral economics, Alchian explains that firms most decidedly do not - cannot - actually operate as rational profit maximizers. Nevertheless, economists can make useful predictions even in a world of uncertainty and incomplete information because market environments “adopt” those firms that best fit their environments, permitting them to be modeled as if they behave rationally. This insight has important and under-appreciated implications for the debate today over the usefulness of behavioral economics.Alchian's explanation of the role of market forces in shaping outcomes poses a serious challenge to behavioralists' claims. While Alchian's (and our) conclusions are born out of the same realization that uncertainty pervades economic decision making that preoccupies the behavioralists, his work suggests a very different conclusion: The evolutionary pressures identified by Alchian may have led to seemingly inefficient firms and other institutions that, in actuality, constrain the effects of bias by market participants. In other words, the very “defects” of profitable firms - from conservatism to excessive bureaucracy to agency costs - may actually support their relative efficiency and effectiveness, even if they appear problematic, costly or inefficient. In fact, their very persistence argues strongly for that conclusion.In Part I, we offer a short summary of Uncertainty, Evolution, and Economic Theory. In Part II, we explain the implications of Alchian's paper for behavioral economics. Part III looks at some findings from experimental economics, and the banking industry in particular, to demonstrate how biases are constrained by firms and other institutions - in ways often misunderstood by behavioral economists. In Part IV, we consider what Alchian's model means for government regulation (with special emphasis on antitrust and consumer protection regulation).","2014","2022-06-25 07:35:47","2022-06-25 07:35:47","","","27","","","","","","","","","","George Mason University School of Law","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 3W0NkAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=3W0NkAEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A sequel to the author's two earlier studies, of royal officials under Charles I (1625-1642) and office-holders under the Commonwealth and the Cromwellian Protectorate (1649-1660), it sets out to explore the extent to which the restoration of the monarchy undid the changes brought about under the Republic. The authorlooks at the institutions of government, its methods and procedures, the terms and conditions of service, and its personnel both collectively and individually. He considers the policies, tasks, successes, and failures of the regime, and relates these to the process of state formation and to the impact of the state on society.

"EM4WU7A5","book","2019","Hathaway, Jane","The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule: 1516–1800","","978-1-00-003425-7","","","","The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule assesses the effects of Ottoman rule on the Arab Lands of Egypt, Greater Syria, Iraq, and Yemen between 1516 and 1800. Drawing attention to the important history of these regions, the book challenges outmoded perceptions of this period as a demoralizing prelude to the rise of Arab nationalism and Arab nation-states in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As well as exploring political events and developments, it delves into the extensive social, cultural, and economic changes that helped to shape the foundations of today's modern Middle and Near East. In doing so, it provides a detailed view of society, incorporating all socio-economic classes, as well as women, religious minorities, and slaves. This second edition has been significantly revised and updated and reflects the developments in research and scholarship since the publication of the first edition.  Engaging with a wide range of primary sources and enhanced by a variety of maps and images to illustrate the text, The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule is a unique and essential resource for students of early modern Ottoman history and the early modern Middle East.","2019-12-06","2022-06-25 07:47:40","2022-06-25 07:47:40","","","229","","","","","The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: NGjIDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=NGjIDwAAQBAJ","","History / General; History / Europe / General; History / Modern / 17th Century; History / Modern / 18th Century; History / Asia / General; History / Modern / 16th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"XDIF6JJH","book","2018","Barkey, Karen","Bandits and Bureaucrats: The Ottoman Route to State Centralization","","978-1-5017-2087-1","","","","Why did the main challenge to the Ottoman state come not in peasant or elite rebellions, but in endemic banditry? Karen Barkey shows how Turkish strategies of incorporating peasants and rotating elites kept both groups dependent on the state, unable and unwilling to rebel. Bandits, formerly mercenary soldiers, were not interested in rebellion but concentrated on trying to gain state resources, more as rogue clients than as primitive rebels. The state's ability to control and manipulate bandits—through deals, bargains and patronage—suggests imperial strength rather than weakness, she maintains. Bandits and Bureaucrats details, in a rich, archivally based analysis, state-society relations in the Ottoman empire during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Exploring current eurocentric theories of state building, the author illuminates a period often mischaracterized as one in which the state declined in power. Outlining the processes of imperial rule, Barkey relates the state political and military institutions to their socal foundations. She compares the Ottoman route with state centralization in the Chinese and Russian empires, and contrasts experiences of rebellion in France during the same period. Bandits and Bureaucrats thus develops a theoretical interpretation of imperial state centralization through incorporation and bargaining with social groups, and at the same time enriches our understanding of the dynamics of Ottoman history.","2018-10-18","2022-06-25 07:55:53","2022-06-25 07:55:53","","","300","","","","","Bandits and Bureaucrats","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0utzDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0utzDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Europe / General; History / Middle East / Turkey & Ottoman Empire","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Converging findings from a variety of disciplines are leading to the emergence of a fundamentally new view of the human mind, and with it a new framework for the behavioral and social sciences. First, with the advent of the cognitive revolution, human nature can finally be defined precisely as the set of universal, species-typical information-processing programs that operate beneath the surface of expressed cultural variability. Second, this collection of cognitive programs evolved in the Pleistocene to solve the adaptive problems regularly faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors--problems such as mate selection, language acquisition, cooperation, and sexual infidelity. Consequently, the traditional view of the mind as a general-purpose computer, tabula rasa, or passive recipient of culture is being replaced by the view that the mind resembles an intricate network of functionally specialized computers, each of which imposes contentful structure on human mental organization and culture. The Adapted Mind explores this new approach--evolutionary psychology--and its implications for a new view of culture.","1995-10-19","2022-06-25 08:58:53","2022-06-25 08:58:53","","","679","","","","","The Adapted Mind","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: dIGKDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=dIGKDgAAQBAJ","","Psychology / Cognitive Psychology & Cognition; Science / Life Sciences / Evolution; Science / Paleontology; Social Science / Anthropology / Physical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or are unable to perform in many of today's developing countries—with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world.Francis Fukuyama, author of the bestselling The End of History and the Last Man and one of our most important political thinkers, provides a sweeping account of how today's basic political institutions developed. The first of a major two-volume work, The Origins of Political Order begins with politics among our primate ancestors and follows the story through the emergence of tribal societies, the growth of the first modern state in China, the beginning of the rule of law in India and the Middle East, and the development of political accountability in Europe up until the eve of the French Revolution.Drawing on a vast body of knowledge—history, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and economics—Fukuyama has produced a brilliant, provocative work that offers fresh insights on the origins of democratic societies and raises essential questions about the nature of politics and its discontents.","2011-04-12","2022-06-25 09:08:44","2022-06-25 09:08:44","","","606","","","","","The Origins of Political Order","","","","","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: eyEONn0WUmMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eyEONn0WUmMC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study of the economic, social, legal and religious position of three minorities (Jews, Muslims and pagan Turkic nomads) argues that different degrees of exclusion and integration characterized medieval non-Christian status in the medieval Christian kingdom of Hungary between 1000 and 1300. A complex explanation of non-Christian status emerges from the analysis of their economic, social, legal and religious positions and roles. Existence on the frontier with the nomadic world led to the formulation of a frontier ideology, and to anxiety about Hungary's detachment from Christendom, which affected policies towards non-Christians. The study also succeeds in integrating central European history with the study of the medieval world, while challenging such current concepts in medieval studies as frontier societies, persecution and tolerance, ethnicity and 'the other'.","2001-05-17","2022-06-25 09:09:24","2022-06-25 09:09:33","","","363","","","","","At the Gate of Christendom","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: QilobDXhObYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=QilobDXhObYC","","History / Europe / General; History / Europe / Western; History / Europe / Medieval; Social Science / Islamic Studies; Religion / Christian Church / History; Social Science / Jewish Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Out of this upheaval came the Western idea of integrated legal systems consciously developed over generations and centuries.Harold J. Berman describes the main features of these systems of law, including the canon law of the church, the royal law of the major kingdoms, the urban law of the newly emerging cities, feudal law, manorial law, and mercantile law. In the coexistence and competition of these systems he finds an important source of the Western belief in the supremacy of law.Written simply and dramatically, carrying a wealth of detail for the scholar but also a fascinating story for the layman, the book grapples with wideranging questions of our heritage and our future. One of its main themes is the interaction between the Western belief in legal evolution and the periodic outbreak of apocalyptic revolutionary upheavals.Berman challenges conventional nationalist approaches to legal history, which have neglected the common foundations of all Western legal systems. He also questions conventional social theory, which has paid insufficient attention to the origin of modem Western legal systems and has therefore misjudged the nature of the crisis of the legal tradition in the twentieth century.","1983","2022-06-25 09:10:00","2022-06-25 09:10:00","","","657","","","","","Law and Revolution","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: VfLSnQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=VfLSnQEACAAJ","","Law / General; Political Science / Law Enforcement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"BVKSBJ68","book","2008","Caldwell, Bruce","Hayek's Challenge: An Intellectual Biography of F.A. Hayek","","978-0-226-09192-1","","","","Friedrich A. Hayek is regarded as one of the preeminent economic theorists of the twentieth century, as much for his work outside of economics as for his work within it. During a career spanning several decades, he made contributions in fields as diverse as psychology, political philosophy, the history of ideas, and the methodology of the social sciences. Bruce Caldwell—editor of The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek—understands Hayek's thought like few others, and with this book he offers us the first full intellectual biography of this pivotal social theorist.  Caldwell begins by providing the necessary background for understanding Hayek's thought, tracing the emergence, in fin-de-siècle Vienna, of the Austrian school of economics—a distinctive analysis forged in the midst of contending schools of thought. In the second part of the book, Caldwell follows the path by which Hayek, beginning from the standard Austrian assumptions, gradually developed his unique perspective on not only economics but a broad range of social phenomena. In the third part, Caldwell offers both an assessment of Hayek's arguments and, in an epilogue, an insightful estimation of how Hayek's insights can help us to clarify and reexamine changes in the field of economics during the twentieth century.  As Hayek's ideas matured, he became increasingly critical of developments within mainstream economics: his works grew increasingly contrarian and evolved in striking—and sometimes seemingly contradictory—ways. Caldwell is ideally suited to explain the complex evolution of Hayek's thought, and his analysis here is nothing short of brilliant, impressively situating Hayek in a broader intellectual context, unpacking the often difficult turns in his thinking, and showing how his economic ideas came to inform his ideas on the other social sciences.  Hayek's Challenge will be received as one of the most important works published on this thinker in recent decades.","2008-12-05","2022-06-28 07:58:14","2022-06-28 07:58:14","","","503","","","","","Hayek's Challenge","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: sNXdj6A0CYcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=sNXdj6A0CYcC","","Business & Economics / General; Business & Economics / Economics / Theory; Biography & Autobiography / Business","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, although programs to foster the rule of law abroad have mushroomed, well-grounded knowledge about what factors ensure success, and why, remains scarce.

The collection draws particular attention to the reverberations of larger socio-cultural and politico-economic processes in the formation of sociality, intimate relations, family histories, reproductive strategies and gender relations – and vice-versa.   Drawing on a wealth of ethnographic material from the late imperial period and from contemporary Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, from northern and southern regions as well as from rural and urban settings, the volume provides unique insights into the historical and spatial diversities of the Chinese kinship experience. This emphasis on diversity challenges the classic ‘lineage paradigm’ of Chinese kinship and establishes a dialogue with contemporary anthropological debates about human kinship reflecting on the emergence of radically new family formations in the Euro-American context.

This book examines the strategies and tactics of international actors, local political elites, and civil society groups to build or rebuild public institutions before they reach the point of failure —to make the state work.It is frequently assumed that the collapse of state structures leads to a vacuum of political power. This is rarely the case. Basic questions of how best to ensure physical and economic security don't disappear when the institutions of the state break down. Non-state actors in such situations may exercise political power over local populations to provide basic social services from education to medical care. Even where non-state actors exist as parasites, political life goes on.How to engage in such an environment is a problem for policymakers in intergovernmental organizations and donor governments. But it poses far greater difficulties for the embattled state institutions and the populations of such territories. Making States Work examines how these various actors have responded to crises in the legitimacy and viability of state institutions, emphasizing situations in which the state has been salvaged or at least kept afloat.","2005","2022-06-28 08:07:08","2022-07-01 04:27:38","","","419","","","","","Making States Work","","","","","United Nations University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=V7EibJ74C-UC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / American Government / National; Political Science / American Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England, and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In A Farewell to Alms, Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations.  Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education.  The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations.  A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, A Farewell to Alms may change the way global economic history is understood.","2009-01-18","2022-06-28 08:34:26","2022-06-28 08:34:26","","","432","","","","","A Farewell to Alms","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: VKBOmAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=VKBOmAEACAAJ","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; History / Social History; Business & Economics / Economics / Theory; Business & Economics / Economic History; Business & Economics / Labor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"R4SBHUBS","book","2007","Collier, Paul","The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It","","978-0-19-804254-9","","","","In the universally acclaimed and award-winning The Bottom Billion, Paul Collier reveals that fifty failed states--home to the poorest one billion people on Earth--pose the central challenge of the developing world in the twenty-first century. The book shines much-needed light on this group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, that are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world's people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nations between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, pointing to a set of traps that ensnare these countries, including civil war, a dependence on the extraction and export of natural resources, and bad governance. Standard solutions do not work, he writes; aid is often ineffective, and globalization can actually make matters worse, driving development to more stable nations. What the bottom billion need, Collier argues, is a bold new plan supported by the Group of Eight industrialized nations. If failed states are ever to be helped, the G8 will have to adopt preferential trade policies, new laws against corruption, new international charters, and even conduct carefully calibrated military interventions. Collier has spent a lifetime working to end global poverty. In The Bottom Billion, he offers real hope for solving one of the great humanitarian crises facing the world today.

"7BCDYQAF","book","2000","Jackson, Michael","At Home in the World","","978-0-8223-2538-3","","","","Ours is a century of uprootedness, with fewer and fewer people living out their lives where they are born. At such a time, in such a world, what does it mean to be ""at home?"" Perhaps among a nomadic people, for whom dwelling is not synonymous with being housed and settled, the search for an answer to this question might lead to a new way of thinking about home and homelessness, exile and belonging. At Home in the World is the story of just such a search. Intermittently over a period of three years Michael Jackson lived, worked, and traveled extensively in Central Australia. This book chronicles his experience among the Warlpiri of the Tanami Desert. Something of a nomad himself, having lived in New Zealand, Sierra Leone, England, France, Australia, and the United States, Jackson is deft at capturing the ambiguities of home as a lived experience among the Warlpiri. Blending narrative ethnography, empirical research, philosophy, and poetry, he focuses on the existential meaning of being at home in the world. Here home becomes a metaphor for the intimate relationship between the part of the world a person calls ""self"" and the part of the world called ""other."" To speak of ""at-homeness,"" Jackson suggests, implies that people everywhere try to strike a balance between closure and openness, between acting and being acted upon, between acquiescing in the given and choosing their own fate. His book is an exhilarating journey into this existential struggle, responsive at every turn to the political questions of equity and justice that such a struggle entails. A moving depiction of an aboriginal culture at once at home and in exile, and a personal meditation on the practice of ethnography and the meaning of home in our increasingly rootless age, At Home in the World is a timely reflection on how, in defining home, we continue to define ourselves.","2000","2022-06-28 08:36:08","2022-06-28 08:36:08","","","212","","","","","","","","","","Duke University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IQuBs9iEVL4C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=IQuBs9iEVL4C","","Social Science / Anthropology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kent Deng reveals China’s mega-cycle of prosperity-poverty-prosperity without the usual attribution to the 1840 Opium War, or the alleged population pressure, class struggle and oriental despotism. The book challenges the conventional view on ‘rebellions’, ‘revolutions’ and their alleged motivations and outcomes. Its findings separate commonly circulated myth with reality based on solid evidence and careful evaluation. The benchmark used by the author is people’s entitlement and mundane day-to-day material well being, instead of the stereotype of aggregates of industrial hardware and national GDP.  China’s Political economy in Modern Times proves that state-building was the prime mover in China’s modern history. Contrary to the popular belief in mass movement, Deng shows convincingly that changes were in most cases imposed by a minority with external help. Therefore, the quality of the state was unpredictable, seen from the anti-state that cost lives and economic growth.   This book will be of interest to students and scholars of Chinese Politics, Chinese Economics, Chinese History, and Political Economy.","2011-10-04","2022-06-28 08:38:57","2022-06-28 08:38:57","","","313","","","","","China's Political Economy in Modern Times","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 1aWpAgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=1aWpAgAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; History / Asia / China; Business & Economics / Economic Conditions; Business & Economics / International / Economics & Trade; Political Science / World / Asian; Social Science / Regional Studies; Political Science / Political Economy; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our biology predisposes us to see and understand the world in different ways, not always reason and the careful consideration of facts. These predispositions are in turn responsible for a significant portion of the political and ideological conflict that marks human history. With verve and wit, renowned social scientists John Hibbing, Kevin Smith, and John Alford—pioneers in the field of biopolitics—present overwhelming evidence that people differ politically not just because they grew up in different cultures or were presented with different information. Despite the oft-heard longing for consensus, unity, and peace, the universal rift between conservatives and liberals endures because people have diverse psychological, physiological, and genetic traits. These biological differences influence much of what makes people who they are, including their orientations to politics. Political disputes typically spring from the assumption that those who do not agree with us are shallow, misguided, uninformed, and ignorant. Predisposed suggests instead that political opponents simply experience, process, and respond to the world differently. It follows, then, that the key to getting along politically is not the ability of one side to persuade the other side to see the error of its ways but rather the ability of each side to see that the other is different, not just politically, but physically. Predisposed will change the way you think about politics and partisan conflict. As a bonus, the book includes a ""Left/Right 20 Questions"" game to test whether your predispositions lean liberal or conservative.","2013-09-23","2022-06-28 08:38:28","2022-06-28 08:38:28","","","362","","","","","Predisposed","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: SVL7AAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=SVL7AAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Science / Life Sciences / Biology; Psychology / Cognitive Psychology & Cognition; Psychology / Social Psychology; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Conservatism & Liberalism; Psychology / Neuropsychology; Science / Life Sciences / Genetics & Genomics; Science / Life Sciences / Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reason for this underground economy is the enormous complexity of Peru's legal machinery. Hundreds of new regulations are passed each week and no private entrepreneur can hope to deal with the bureaucracy. Through detailed field studies, this book calculates the enormous economic effects of laws regulating such diverse matters as housing construction, the establishment of industries, public transport and trade. For many readers, however, the greatest contribution of this book is its political analysis.

In 1974, nearly three-quarters of all countries were dictatorships; today, more than half are democracies. Yet recent efforts to promote democracy have stumbled, and many democratic governments are faltering. In this bold and sweeping vision for advancing freedom around the world, social scientist Larry Diamond examines how and why democracy progresses. He demonstrates that the desire for democracy runs deep, even in very poor countries, and that seemingly entrenched regimes like Iran and China could become democracies within a generation. He also dissects the causes of the ""democratic recession"" in critical states, including the crime-infested oligarchy in Russia and the strong-armed populism of Venezuela. Diamond cautions that arrogance and inconsistency have undermined America's aspirations to promote democracy. To spur a renewed democratic boom, he urges vigorous support of good governance—the rule of law, security, protection of individual rights, and shared economic prosperity—and free civic organizations. Only then will the spirit of democracy be secured.","2008-01-08","2022-06-28 08:40:52","2022-06-28 08:40:52","","","464","","","","","The Spirit of Democracy","","","","","Macmillan","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: w_Wsd5GZU0QC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=w_Wsd5GZU0QC","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; History / Modern / 21st Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our understanding of the rise of the nation-state is based heavily on the Western European experience of war. Challenging the dominance of this model, Blood and Debt looks at Latin America&#39;s much different experience as more relevant to politics today in regions as varied as the Balkans and sub-Saharan Africa. The book&#39;s illuminating review of the relatively peaceful history of Latin America from the late eighteenth through the early twentieth centuries reveals the lack of two critical prerequisites needed for war: a political and military culture oriented toward international violence, and the state institutional capacity to carry it out. Using innovative new data such as tax receipts, naming of streets and public monuments, and conscription records, the author carefully examines how war affected the fiscal development of the state, the creation of national identity, and claims to citizenship. Rather than building nation-states and fostering democratic citizenship, he shows, war in Latin America destroyed institutions, confirmed internal divisions, and killed many without purpose or glory.","2002-01-01","2022-06-29 07:21:19","2022-06-29 07:21:19","","","343","","","","","Blood and Debt","","","","","Penn State Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: fnGt3dKxgRcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=fnGt3dKxgRcC","","Social Science / Sociology / General; History / Latin America / General; History / Modern / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper investigates inter-class mobility potential and its evolution over time in the case of selected countries. As a result of the estimations, we find that Latin American countries have smaller middle classes than OECD countries. Moreover, this comparison shows that, while middle-class upward mobility potential is not very different, middle class resilience is higher in OECD countries. This suggests that particular attention should be paid to mitigating the impact of economic reversal on middle-class families, as they are more vulnerable to falling into poverty. This analysis provides a tool to identify the features of the middle class that need to be promoted by policy makers to foster middle-class resilience and enhance its stabilising role in society.","2011","2022-06-29 07:20:02","2022-06-29 07:20:02","","","45","","","","","","","","","","OECD Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ellLnQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ellLnQEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Maxeiner takes on the challenge of demonstrating that historically American law makers did consider a statutory methodology as part of formulating laws. In the nineteenth century, when the people wanted laws they could understand, lawyers inflicted judge-made, statute-destroying, common law on them. Maxeiner offers the cure for common law, in the form of sensible statute law. Building on this historical evidence, Maxeiner shows how rule-making in civil law jurisdictions in other countries makes for a far more equitable legal system. Sensible statute laws fit together: one statute governs, as opposed to several laws that even lawyers have trouble disentangling. In a statute law system, lawmakers make laws for the common good in sensible procedures, and judges apply sensible laws and do not make them. This book shows how such a system works in Germany and how it would be a solution for the American legal system as well.","2018-03-08","2022-06-29 07:19:29","2022-06-29 07:19:29","","","367","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: qHRJDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=qHRJDwAAQBAJ","","Law / Comparative; Law / General; Law / Jurisprudence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this pioneering book, Daniel Carpenter contributes to our understanding of institutions by presenting a unified study of bureaucratic autonomy in democratic regimes. He focuses on the emergence of bureaucratic policy innovation in the United States during the Progressive Era, asking why the Post Office Department and the Department of Agriculture became politically independent authors of new policy and why the Interior Department did not. To explain these developments, Carpenter offers a new theory of bureaucratic autonomy grounded in organization theory, rational choice models, and network concepts. According to the author, bureaucracies with unique goals achieve autonomy when their middle-level officials establish reputations among diverse coalitions for effectively providing unique services. These coalitions enable agencies to resist political control and make it costly for politicians to ignore the agencies' ideas. Carpenter assesses his argument through a highly innovative combination of historical narratives, statistical analyses, counterfactuals, and carefully structured policy comparisons. Along the way, he reinterprets the rise of national food and drug regulation, Comstockery and the Progressive anti-vice movement, the emergence of American conservation policy, the ascent of the farm lobby, the creation of postal savings banks and free rural mail delivery, and even the congressional Cannon Revolt of 1910.","2020-06-16","2022-06-29 07:14:50","2022-06-29 07:14:50","","","500","","","","","The Forging of Bureaucratic Autonomy","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: gGzdDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=gGzdDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although one could cynically ask this question just as easily about the United States’s mature democracy, Diego Abente Brun and Larry Diamond ask this question about democracies in the developing world through an assessment of political clientelism, or what is commonly known as patronage. Studies of political clientelism, whether deployed through traditional vote-buying techniques or through the politicized use of social spending, were a priority in the 1970s, when democratization efforts around the world flourished. With the rise of the Washington Consensus and neoliberal economic policies during the late-1980s, clientelism studies were moved to the back of the scholarly agenda. Abente Brun and Diamond invited some of the best social scientists in the field to systematically explore how political clientelism works and evolves in the context of modern developing democracies, with particular reference to social policies aimed at reducing poverty.Clientelism, Social Policy, and the Quality of Democracy is balanced between a section devoted to understanding clientelism’s infamous effects and history in Latin America and a section that draws out implications for other regions, specifically Africa, Southeast Asia, and Eastern and Central Europe. These rich and instructive case studies glean larger comparative lessons that can help scholars understand how countries regulate the natural sociological reflex toward clientelistic ties in their quest to build that most elusive of all political structures—a fair, efficient, and accountable state based on impersonal criteria and the rule of law.In an era when democracy is increasingly snagged on the age-old practice of patronage, students and scholars of political science, comparative politics, democratization, and international development and economics will be interested in this assessment, which calls for the study of better, more efficient, and just governance.","2014-03","2022-06-29 06:47:09","2022-06-29 06:47:09","","","284","","","","","","","","","","JHU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: or3DAgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=or3DAgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; POLITICAL SCIENCE / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital technologies—with hardware, software, and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age alters how we think about issues of technological, societal, and economic progress.","2016","2022-06-29 06:44:20","2022-06-29 06:44:20","","","306","","","","","The Second Machine Age","","","","","W.W.

Yet, far from moving beyond the nation-state, fin-de-siècle Europe has been moving back to the nation-state, most spectacularly with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia into a score of nationally defined successor states. This massive reorganization of political space along national lines has engendered distinctive, dynamically interlocking, and in some cases explosive forms of nationalism: the autonomist nationalisms of national minorities, the ""nationalizing"" nationalisms of the new states in which they live, and the transborder nationalisms of the external national ""homelands"" to which they belong by shared ethnicity though not by citizenship. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu and the 'new institutionalist' sociology, and comparing contemporary nationalisms with those of interwar Europe, Rogers Brubaker provides a theoretically sophisticated and historically rich account of one of the most important problems facing the 'New Europe'.--Publisher description.","1996-09-28","2022-06-29 06:43:39","2022-06-29 06:43:47","","","220","","","","","Nationalism Reframed","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: O3Bfhfghi50C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=O3Bfhfghi50C","","Political Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ZR8HB3ZE","book","2019","Sparling, Robert Alan","Political Corruption: The Underside of Civic Morality","","978-0-8122-5087-9","","","","The notion of corruption as a problem for politics spans many centuries and political, social, and cultural contexts. But it is incredibly difficult to define what we mean when we describe a regime or actor as corrupt: while corruption suggests a falling away from purity, health, or integrity, it flourishes today in an environment that is often inarticulate about its moral ideals and wary of perfectionist discourse. Providing a historical perspective on the idea, Robert Alan Sparling explores diverse visions of corruption that have been elucidated by thinkers across the modern philosophical tradition.In a series of chronologically ordered philosophical portraits, Political Corruption considers the different ways in which a metaphor of impurity, disease, and dissolution was deployed by political philosophers from the Renaissance to the early twentieth century. Focusing specifically on the thought of Erasmus, Étienne de La Boétie, Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Bolingbroke, Robespierre, Kant, and Weber, Sparling situates these thinkers in their historical contexts and argues that each of them offers a distinctive vision of corruption that has continuing relevance in contemporary political debates. He contrasts immoderate purists with impure moderates and reveals corruption to be a language of reaction and revolution. The book explores themes such as the nature of civic trust and distrust; the relationship of transparency to accountability; the integrity of leaders and the character of uncorrupted citizens; the division between public and private; the nature of dependency; and the relationship between regime and civic disposition.Political Corruption examines how philosophers have conceived of public office and its abuse and how they have sought to insulate the public sphere from anticivic inclinations and interests. Sparling argues that speaking coherently about political corruption in our present moment requires a robust account of the good regime and of the character of its citizens and officeholders.","2019-05-03","2022-06-29 06:43:08","2022-06-29 06:43:08","","","272","","","","","Political Corruption","","","","","University of Pennsylvania Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=-DiPDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / Political Process / General; Political Science / Corruption & Misconduct","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Widely read and quoted it has had a unique influence on teaching and research. This second edition draws on the great volume of new research - produced by Lord Briggs amongst others, since its original publication. The book stresses both the underlying unity and the rich variety of the age, and raises fundamental issues about a period of crucial change in British history - industrialisation, war, constitutional change and the attitudes of politicians towards it, political development, and, not least, society and culture. In the background are the new economic powers based on the development of a coal and iron technology; in the foreground, new social and political problems and new ways of tackling them. The author also discusses perceptions of, and reactions to, changing circumstances, the influence of religion and science on national life, and changing styles in art and literature. The story ends, not with a full stop but with a question mark. Could improvement be maintained?

In this book, Michael Bratton and Nicolas van de Walle analyze the significant political reforms undertaken by some 40 out of 47 sub-Saharan countries in the early 1990s, which included the first competitive elections in a generation. How can this wave of political liberalization be explained? Why did some countries complete a democratic transition, whereas others sustained only limited political reform or suffered authoritarian reversals? What are the long-term prospects for democracy in Africa? In the first study of its kind for sub-Saharan Africa, the authors propose systematic answers to these questions from a cross-national, comparative perspective and in the light of prevailing theories of democratization.","1997-08-13","2022-06-29 06:41:53","2022-07-01 04:23:59","","","336","","","","","Democratic Experiments in Africa","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=h-2nF6ls7B0C","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Berry’s theme: the obstacles to African agrarian development never stay the same. Her book explores the complex way African economy and society are tied to issues of land and labor, offering a comparative study of agrarian change in four rural economies in sub-Saharan Africa, including two that experienced long periods of expanding peasant production for export (southern Ghana and southwestern Nigeria), a settler economy (central Kenya), and a rural labor reserve (northeastern Zambia).  The resources available to African farmers have changed dramatically over the course of the twentieth century. Berry asserts that the ways resources are acquired and used are shaped not only by the incorporation of a rural area into colonial (later national) and global political economies, but also by conflicts over culture, power, and property within and beyond rural communities. By tracing the various debates over rights to resources and their effects on agricultural production and farmers’ uses of income, Berry presents agrarian change as a series of on-going processes rather than a set of discrete “successes” and “failures.”  No Condition Is Permanent enriches the discussion of agrarian development by showing how multidisciplinary studies of local agrarian history can constructively contribute to development policy. The book is a contribution both to African agrarian history and to debates over the role of agriculture in Africa’s recent economic crises.","1993-09-15","2022-06-29 06:35:46","2022-06-29 06:35:46","","","273","","","","","No Condition Is Permanent","","","","","Univ of Wisconsin Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ynOfXVrSsyIC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ynOfXVrSsyIC","","Social Science / General; History / General; Business & Economics / Industries / General; History / Africa / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"MXSNJM8A","book","2016","Cherkaoui, Mohammed D.","What Is Enlightenment?: Continuity or Rupture in the Wake of the Arab Uprisings","","978-0-7391-9368-6","","","","Political sociology has struggled with predicting the next turn of transformation in the MENA countries after the 2011 Uprisings. Arab activists did not articulate explicitly any modalities of their desired system, although their slogans ushered to a fully-democratic society. These unguided Uprisings showcase an open-ended freedom-to question after Arabs underwent their freedom-from struggle from authoritarianism. The new conflicts in Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Libya have fragmented shar’iya (legitimacy) into distinct conceptualizations: “revolutionary legitimacy,” “electoral legitimacy,” “legitimacy of the street,” and “consensual legitimacy.” This volume examines whether the Uprisings would introduce a replica of the European Enlightenment or rather stimulate an Arab/Islamic awakening with its own cultural specificity and political philosophy. By placing Immanuel Kant in Tahrir Square, this book adopts a comparative analysis of two enlightenment projects: one Arab, still under construction, with possible progression toward modernity or regression toward neo-authoritarianism, and one European, shaped by the past two centuries.Mohammed D. Cherkaoui and the contributing authors use a hybrid theoretical framework drawing on three tanwiri (enlightenment) philosophers from different eras: Ibn Rushd, known in the west as Averroes (the twelfth century), Immanuel Kant (the eighteenth century), and Mohamed Abed Al-Jabri (the twentieth century). The authors propose a few projections about the outcome of the competition between an Islamocracy vision and what Cherkaoui terms as a Demoslamic vision, since it implies the Islamist movements’ flexibility to reconcile their religious absolutism with the prerequisites of liberal democracy. This book also traces the patterns of change which point to a possible Arab Axial Age. It ends with the trials of modernity and tradition in Tunisia and an imaginary speech Kant would deliver at the Tunisian Parliament after those vibrant debates of the new constitution in 2014.","2016-04-11","2022-06-29 06:34:37","2022-06-29 06:34:37","","","405","","","","","What Is Enlightenment?","","","","","Lexington Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7aHACwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=7aHACwAAQBAJ","","Philosophy / Political; Political Science / World / Middle Eastern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a new introduction by Bell. In 1976, when Daniel Bell first published The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, he predicted a vastly different world-one that would rely upon an economics of information, as opposed to the economics of goods that had existed up to then. Bell argued that the new society would not displace the old one but rather overlay it in profound ways, much as industrialization continues to coexist with the agrarian sectors of our society. In Bell's prescient vision, the post-industrial society would include the birth and growth of a knowledge class, a change from goods to services, and changes in the role of women. All of these would be based upon an increasing dependence on science as a means of innovation; as a means of technical and social change. The Coming of Post-Industrial Society remains an important book for a whole new generation of politicians, economists, intellectuals, and students. --Publisher.","1976","2022-06-29 06:34:17","2022-06-29 06:34:17","","","602","","","","","The Coming of Post-industrial Society","","","","","Basic Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: hlS6AAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=hlS6AAAAIAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite the great tension, pressures and crises, a new working philosophy was created to unite the PM, the Chancellor, the Cabinet and top civil servants behind the mission and to focus the entire government machine on delivering results.

In practice, narratives of left versus right or government versus the people do not begin to capture the dynamic ways Americans pursue civic goals while protecting individual freedoms. Brian Balogh proposes a new view of U.S. politics that illuminates how public and private actors collaborate to achieve collective goals. This ""associational synthesis"" treats the relationship between state and civil society as fluid and challenges interpretations that map the trajectory of American politics solely along ideological lines. Rather, both liberals and conservatives have extended the authority of the state but have done so most successfully when state action is mediated through nongovernmental institutions, such as universities, corporations, interest groups, and other voluntary organizations.The Associational State provides a fresh perspective on the crucial role that the private sector, trade associations, and professional organizations have played in implementing public policies from the late nineteenth through the twenty-first century. Balogh examines key historical periods through the lens of political development, paying particular attention to the ways government, social movements, and intermediary institutions have organized support and resources to achieve public ends. Exposing the gap between the ideological rhetoric that both parties deploy today and their far less ideologically driven behavior over the past century and a half, The Associational State offers one solution to the partisan gridlock that currently grips the nation.","2015-06-04","2022-06-29 06:23:24","2022-06-29 06:23:24","","","288","","","","","The Associational State","","","","","University of Pennsylvania Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wYcXCAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wYcXCAAAQBAJ","","History / United States / 20th Century; Political Science / Political Process / General; Political Science / American Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How can poor and weak societies escape poverty traps? Political economists have traditionally offered three answers: ""stimulate growth first,"" ""build good institutions first,"" or ""some fortunate nations inherited good institutions that led to growth."" Yuen Yuen Ang rejects all three schools of thought and their underlying assumptions: linear causation, a mechanistic worldview, and historical determinism. Instead, she launches a new paradigm grounded in complex adaptive systems, which embraces the reality of interdependence and humanity's capacity to innovate. Combining this original lens with more than 400 interviews with Chinese bureaucrats and entrepreneurs, Ang systematically reenacts the complex process that turned China from a communist backwater into a global juggernaut in just 35 years. Contrary to popular misconceptions, she shows that what drove China's great transformation was not centralized authoritarian control, but ""directed improvisation""—top-down directions from Beijing paired with bottom-up improvisation among local officials. Her analysis reveals two broad lessons on development. First, transformative change requires an adaptive governing system that empowers ground-level actors to create new solutions for evolving problems. Second, the first step out of the poverty trap is to ""use what you have""—harnessing existing resources to kick-start new markets, even if that means defying first-world norms. Bold and meticulously researched, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap opens up a whole new avenue of thinking for scholars, practitioners, and anyone seeking to build adaptive systems.","2016-09-06","2022-06-29 06:22:07","2022-06-29 06:22:07","","","345","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: _sOdDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=_sOdDgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; History / Asia / China; Political Science / Political Economy; Social Science / Poverty & Homelessness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this greatly anticipated revised edition, Anderson updates and elaborates on the core question: what makes people live and die for nations, as well as hate and kill in their name? Anderson examines the creation and global spread of the ‘imagined communities’ of nationality, and explores the processes that created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the decline of antique kinship, the interaction between capitalism and print, the development of secular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of time and space. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas was adopted by popular movements in Europe, by imperialist powers, and by the movements of anti-imperialist resistance in Asia and Africa.In a new afterword, Anderson examines the extraordinary influence of Imagined Communities, and the book's international publication and reception, from the end of the Cold War era to the present day.","2006-11-17","2022-06-29 06:18:42","2022-06-29 06:18:42","","","266","","","","","Imagined Communities","","","","","Verso","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=nQ9jXXJV-vgC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Nationalism & Patriotism; Political Science / Political Ideologies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why does it sometimes consolidate only to collapse at other times? Written by two of the foremost authorities on this subject in the world, this volume develops a framework for analyzing the creation and consolidation of democracy. It revolutionizes scholarship on the factors underlying government and popular movements toward democracy or dictatorship. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue that different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Their book, the subject of a four-day seminar at Harvard's Center for Basic Research in the Social Sciences, was also the basis for the Walras-Bowley lecture at the joint meetings of the European Economic Association and Econometric Society in 2003 and is the winner of the John Bates Clark Medal. Daron Acemoglu is Charles P. Kindleberger Professor of Applied Economics at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received the 2005 John Bates Clark Medal awarded by the American Economic Association as the best economist working in the United States under age 40. He is the author of the forthcoming text Introduction to Modern Economic Growth. James A. Robinson is Professor of Government at Harvard University. He is a Harvard Faculty Associate at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and a member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research's Program on Institutions, Organizations, and Growth.

Corporate governance needs to respond to society’s rising expectations of directors and boards as the impact of the global intellectual property ecosystem is felt. How can a responsible corporate culture of IP transparency be stimulated to create a rosy future to connect corporate communication with the desires of shareholders, investors and other stakeholders? The astonishing lack of material quantitative and qualitative information companies report about their IP assets makes it difficult for shareholders and other stakeholders to assess directors’ stewardship of those assets – a pressing corporate governance issue in the 21st century. This book advances IP reporting in alignment with the key corporate governance principles of transparency and disclosure. It analyses the juncture between the IP ecosystem; corporate finance and accounting for intangibles; and corporate governance. Patents, mini-case studies and an original business triage style model for assessing IP disclosures are used to illustrate the gaps corporate governance theory needs to address. Focussing on the common law tradition of corporate governance in England and Wales, intangibles and IP reporting developments in other jurisdictions are also explored.","2018-04-19","2022-06-29 06:11:03","2022-06-29 06:11:03","","","332","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: O0xWDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=O0xWDwAAQBAJ","","Law / General; Law / Corporate; Law / Intellectual Property / General; Law / Intellectual Property / Patent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies are? Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are mired in poverty and violence? Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in economic opportunities. The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional trajectories. Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for the big questions of today, including: - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such high speed and overwhelm the West? - Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and empowers a small minority? - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions? Why Nations Fail will change the way you look at—and understand—the world.","2012-03-20","2022-06-29 06:10:25","2022-06-29 06:10:25","","","546","","","","","Why Nations Fail","","","","","Crown","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: yIV_NMDDIvYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=yIV_NMDDIvYC","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Economic History; Business & Economics / International / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We document this reversal using data on urbanization patterns and population density, which, we argue, proxy for economic prosperity. This reversal is inconsistent with a view that links economic development to geographic factors. According to the geography view, societies that were relatively rich in 1500 should also be relatively rich today. In contrast, the reversal is consistent with the role of institutions in economic development. The expansion of European overseas empires starting in the 15th century led to a major change in the institutions of the societies they colonized. In fact, the European intervention appears to have created an 'institutional reversal' among these societies, in the sense that Europeans were more likely to introduce institutions encouraging investment in regions that were previously poor. This institutional reversal accounts for the reversal in relative incomes. We provide further support for this view by documenting that the reversal in relative incomes took place during the 19th century, and resulted from societies with good institutions taking advantage of industrialization opportunities.","2001","2022-06-29 06:07:34","2022-06-29 06:07:34","","","58","","","","","Reversal of Fortune","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: HVeOXwAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=HVeOXwAACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our argument is that Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. The choice of colonization strategy was, at least in part, determined by whether Europeans could settle in the colony. In places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and they were more likely to set up worse (extractive) institutions. These early institutions persisted to the present. We document evidence supporting these hypotheses. Exploiting differences in mortality rates faced by soldiers, bishops and sailors in the colonies in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita. Our estimates imply that differences in institutions explain approximately three-quarters of the income per capita differences across former colonies. Once we control for the effect of institutions, we find that countries in Africa or those farther away from the equator do not have lower incomes.","2000","2022-06-29 06:07:02","2022-06-29 06:07:02","","","43","","","","","The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ttQeMQAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ttQeMQAACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How and why did these farflung empires form, persist, and finally fall? David Abernethy addresses these questions in this magisterial survey of the rise and decline of European overseas empires.  Abernethy identifies broad patterns across time and space, interweaving them with fascinating details of cross-cultural encounters. He argues that relatively autonomous profit-making, religious, and governmental institutions enabled west European countries to launch triple assaults on other societies. Indigenous people also played a role in their eventual subjugation by inviting Europeans to intervene in their power struggles. Abernethy finds that imperial decline was often the unanticipated result of wars among major powers. Postwar crises over colonies&#39; unmet expectations empowered movements that eventually took territories as diverse as the thirteen British North American colonies, Spain&#39;s South American possessions, India, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, and the Gold Coast to independence.  In advancing a theory of imperialism that includes European and non-European actors, and in analyzing economic, social, and cultural as well as political dimensions of empire, Abernethy helps account for Europe&#39;s long occupation of global center stage. He also sheds light on key features of today&#39;s postcolonial world and the legacies of empire, concluding with an insightful approach to the moral evaluation of colonialism.","2000-01-01","2022-06-29 06:04:29","2022-06-29 06:04:29","","","550","","","","","The Dynamics of Global Dominance","","","","","Yale University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ennqNS1EOuMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ennqNS1EOuMC","","History / Europe / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some changes in the interpretation may have taken place and some deviations here and there can be noticed but the literal meaning of the ideals continues to be the guiding light.

Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or are unable to perform in many of today's developing countries—with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world.Francis Fukuyama, author of the bestselling The End of History and the Last Man and one of our most important political thinkers, provides a sweeping account of how today's basic political institutions developed. The first of a major two-volume work, The Origins of Political Order begins with politics among our primate ancestors and follows the story through the emergence of tribal societies, the growth of the first modern state in China, the beginning of the rule of law in India and the Middle East, and the development of political accountability in Europe up until the eve of the French Revolution.Drawing on a vast body of knowledge—history, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and economics—Fukuyama has produced a brilliant, provocative work that offers fresh insights on the origins of democratic societies and raises essential questions about the nature of politics and its discontents.","2011-04-12","2022-06-28 15:49:36","2022-06-28 15:49:36","","","606","","","","","The Origins of Political Order","","","","","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: eyEONn0WUmMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eyEONn0WUmMC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new, substantial introduction by Robert Carneiro and Burton J. Brown assess White’s historical importance and continuing influence in the discipline. White is credited with reintroducing evolution in a way that had a profound impact on our understanding of the relationship between technology, ecology, and culture in the development of civilizations. A materialist, he was particularly concerned with societies’ ability to harness energy as an indicator of progress, and his empirical analysis of this equation covers a vast historical span. Fearlessly tackling the most fundamental questions of culture and society during the cold war, White was frequently a lightning rod both inside and outside the academy. His book will provoke equally potent debates today, and is a key component of any course or reading list in anthropological or archaeological theory and cultural ecology.","2016-06-16","2022-06-28 15:49:12","2022-06-28 15:49:12","","","347","","","","","The Evolution of Culture","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: D7JmDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=D7JmDAAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Anthropology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"8TB5CGVE","book","2010","Borrello, Mark E.","Evolutionary Restraints: The Contentious History of Group Selection","","978-0-226-06702-5","","","","Much of the evolutionary debate since Darwin has focused on the level at which natural selection occurs. Most biologists acknowledge multiple levels of selection—from the gene to the species. The debate about group selection, however, is the focus of Mark E. Borrello’s Evolutionary Restraints. Tracing the history of biological attempts to determine whether selection leads to the evolution of fitter groups, Borrello takes as his focus the British naturalist V. C. Wynne-Edwards, who proposed that animals could regulate their own populations and thus avoid overexploitation of their resources. By the mid-twentieth century, Wynne-Edwards became an advocate for group selection theory and led a debate that engaged the most significant evolutionary biologists of his time, including Ernst Mayr, G. C. Williams, and Richard Dawkins. This important dialogue bled out into broader conversations about population regulation, environmental crises, and the evolution of human social behavior. By examining a single facet in the long debate about evolution, Borrello provides powerful insight into an intellectual quandary that remains relevant and alive to this day.","2010-10-15","2022-06-28 15:48:52","2022-06-28 15:48:52","","","227","","","","","Evolutionary Restraints","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: vJWuzI5YnJMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=vJWuzI5YnJMC","","Science / General; Science / Life Sciences / Evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book, whose publication promises to be a major scientific event, tells us differently. In Unto Others philosopher Elliott Sober and biologist David Sloan Wilson demonstrate once and for all that unselfish behavior is in fact an important feature of both biological and human nature. Their book provides a panoramic view of altruism throughout the animal kingdom—from self-sacrificing parasites to insects that subsume themselves in the superorganism of a colony to the human capacity for selflessness—even as it explains the evolutionary sense of such behavior. Explaining how altruistic behavior can evolve by natural selection, this book finally gives credence to the idea of group selection that was originally proposed by Darwin but denounced as heretical in the 1960s. With their account of this controversy, Sober and Wilson offer a detailed case study of scientific change as well as an indisputable argument for group selection as a legitimate theory in evolutionary biology. Unto Others also takes a novel evolutionary approach in explaining the ultimate psychological motives behind unselfish human behavior. Developing a theory of the proximate mechanisms that most likely evolved to motivate adaptive helping behavior, Sober and Wilson show how people and perhaps other species evolved the capacity to care for others as a goal in itself. A truly interdisciplinary work that blends biology, philosophy, psychology, and anthropology, this book will permanently change not just our view of selfless behavior but also our understanding of many issues in evolutionary biology and the social sciences.","1999-10","2022-06-28 15:48:24","2022-06-28 15:48:24","","","426","","","","","Unto Others","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ouwg5swAV5oC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ouwg5swAV5oC","","Philosophy / Ethics & Moral Philosophy; Science / Life Sciences / Evolution; Psychology / Social Psychology; Psychology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why do men kill, rape, and wage war, and what can we do about it?

"UUHSBQP7","book","1992","Wriston, Walte","The Twilight of Sovereignty: How the Information Revolution is Transforming Our World","","978-0-684-19454-7","","","","Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citicorp, is among the most innovative financiers of our time. In The Twilight of Sovereignty he lucidly reveals the vast geopolitical implications of the massive information revolution in progress around the globe. Human intelligence and intellectual resources are now the world's prime capital, Wriston shows. Instant global communication - the marriage of satellites, television, fax, cellular telephones, and worldwide computer networks - has had and will continue to have world-shaking consequences. The fundamental result is that national boundaries are increasingly irrelevant, and the traditional power and perquisites of sovereignty are disappearing. The effect of this revolution, says Wriston, is the formation of a new global democratic order: ""No matter what political leaders do or say, the screens will continue to light up, traders will trade, and currency values will continue to be set, not only by sovereign governments but by global plebiscite"", he writes. Today, there can be no more unreported Chernobyl disasters. There can be no more Pearl Harbor-like surprises. The vast migrations on every continent; the drive of informed peoples for self-determination; the collapse of the Soviet empire; the democratization of Latin America; the outburst of ethnic rivalries - all become understandable in the challenging light of Wriston's persuasive analysis. Wriston stresses that in the information revolution, technology itself is of secondary importance. His larger vision is of the transformation of our public and private institutions. Within the corporation, too, the twilight of sovereignty is near. The immediate and simultaneous availability of datato those at every level of authority within the corporation means that in today's business world, traditional executive power is ended. Looking to the future, Wriston outlines the new management philosophies and radically changed managerial structures that will follow the end of corporate centralization. The Twilight of Sovereignty reaffirms Walter Wriston's stature as one of the most cogent thinkers of our time.","1992","2022-06-28 15:40:54","2022-06-28 15:41:06","","","216","","","","","The Twilight of Sovereignty","","","","","Scribner","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: mhnsAAAAMAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=mhnsAAAAMAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fareed Zakaria's international bestseller The Post-American World pointed to the ""rise of the rest""--The growth of countries like China, India, Brazil, and others -- as the great story of our time, the story that will undoubtedly shape the future of global power. Since its publication, the trends he identified have proceeded faster than anyone could have anticipated. The 2008 financial crisis turned the world upside down, stalling the United States and other advanced economies. Meanwhile emerging markets have surged ahead, coupling their economic growth with pride, nationalism, and a determination to shape their own future. In this new edition, Zakaria makes sense of this rapidly changing landscape. With his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination, he draws on lessons from the two great power shifts of the past 500 years -- the rise of the Western world and the rise of the United States -- to tell us what we can expect from the third shift, the ""rise of the rest."" The great challenge for Britain was economic decline. The challenge for America now is political decline, for as others have grown in importance, the central role of the United States, especially in the ascendant emerging markets, has already begun to shrink. As Zakaria eloquently argues, Washington needs to begin a serious transformation of its global strategy, moving from its traditional role of dominating hegemon to that of a more pragmatic, honest broker. It must seek to share power, create coalitions, build legitimacy, and define the global agenda -- all formidable tasks. None of this will be easy for the greatest power the world has ever known -- the only power that for so long has really mattered. America stands at a crossroads: In a new global era where the United States no longer dominates the worldwide economy, orchestrates geopolitics, or overwhelms cultures, can the nation continue to thrive? - Publisher.","2012","2022-06-28 15:40:24","2022-06-28 15:40:24","","","314","","","","","The Post-American World","","","","","W.W.

This unique study of government is the culmination of the work of the late S. E. Finer, one of the leading political scientists of the twentieth century. Ranging over 5,000 years, from the Sumerian city state to the modern European nation state, five themes emerge: state-building, military formats, belief systems, social stratification, and timespan. The three volumes examine both representative and exceptional polities, and focus on political elites of different types. Ancient Monarchies and Empires opens with Finer's masterly Conceptual Prologue, setting out the entire scope and structure of The History .

The theory of dissonance is here applied to the problem of why partial reward, delay of reward , and effort expenditure during training result in increased resistance to extinction.  The author contends that a state of impasse exists within learning theory largely because some of its major assumptions stand in apparent opposition to cetain well-established experimental results. The book puts forward a new theory that seems to reconcile these data and assumptions. This new theory can account for data with which other theories have difficulty: it integrates empirical phenomena that have been regarded as unrelated, and it is supported by the results of experiments designed specifically to test its implications.

"AWS3V7IM","journalArticle","2012","Feldman, Noah","The fall and rise of the Islamic state","","","","","","Perhaps no other Western writer has more deeply probed the bitter struggle in the Muslim world between the forces of religion and law and those of violence and lawlessness as Noah Feldman. His scholarship has defined the stakes in the Middle East today. Now, in this incisive book, Feldman tells the story behind the increasingly popular call for the establishment of the shari'a--the law of the traditional Islamic state--in the modern Muslim world. Western powers call it a threat to democracy. Islamist movements are winning elections on it. Terrorists use it to justify their crimes. What, then, is the shari'a? Given the severity of some of its provisions, why is it popular among Muslims? Can the Islamic state succeed--should it? Feldman reveals how the classical Islamic constitution governed through and was legitimated by law. He shows how executive power was balanced by the scholars who interpreted and administered the shari'a, and how this balance of power was finally destroyed by the tragically incomplete reforms of the modern era. The result has been the unchecked executive dominance that now distorts politics in so many Muslim states. Feldman argues that a modern Islamic state could provide political and legal justice to today's Muslims, but only if new institutions emerge that restore this constitutional balance of power. The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State gives us the sweeping history of the traditional Islamic constitution--its noble beginnings, its downfall, and the renewed promise it could hold for Muslims and Westerners alike. In a new introduction, Feldman discusses developments in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, and other Muslim-majority countries since the Arab Spring and describes how Islamists must meet the challenge of balance if the new Islamic states are to succeed.","2012-01-01","2022-06-28 15:35:32","2022-06-28 15:37:51","","1-189","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290570357_The_fall_and_rise_of_the_Islamic_state","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the writings were first published half a century ago, they created a new agenda for social anthropology. Kinship and Marriage among the Nuer is the second of his trilogy on the society and culture of this pastoral people. It vividly portrays the experience of growing up in a Nuer community, describing daily life, marriage, sex, death, and birth. It also makes clear the essential difference between the discourse of political association and that of kinship, and shows the part played by the kinship system in Nuer society as a whole.

"U2HX5KLK","book","2012","Evans, Peter","Embedded Autonomy: States and Industrial Transformation","","978-1-4008-2172-3","","","","In recent years, debate on the state's economic role has too often devolved into diatribes against intervention. Peter Evans questions such simplistic views, offering a new vision of why state involvement works in some cases and produces disasters in others. To illustrate, he looks at how state agencies, local entrepreneurs, and transnational corporations shaped the emergence of computer industries in Brazil, India, and Korea during the seventies and eighties. Evans starts with the idea that states vary in the way they are organized and tied to society. In some nations, like Zaire, the state is predatory, ruthlessly extracting and providing nothing of value in return. In others, like Korea, it is developmental, promoting industrial transformation. In still others, like Brazil and India, it is in between, sometimes helping, sometimes hindering. Evans's years of comparative research on the successes and failures of state involvement in the process of industrialization have here been crafted into a persuasive and entertaining work, which demonstrates that successful state action requires an understanding of its own limits, a realistic relationship to the global economy, and the combination of coherent internal organization and close links to society that Evans called ""embedded autonomy.""","2012-01-12","2022-06-28 14:37:26","2022-06-28 15:10:26","","","344","","","","","Embedded Autonomy","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: MJBBC9idI48C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=MJBBC9idI48C","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"4L233GC9","book","1985","Evans, Peter","Bringing the State Back In","","978-0-521-31313-1","","","","Until recently, dominant theoretical paradigms in the comparative social sciences did not highlight states as organizational structures or as potentially autonomous actors. Indeed, the term 'state' was rarely used. Current work, however, increasingly views the state as an agent which, although influenced by the society that surrounds it, also shapes social and political processes. The contributors to this volume, which includes some of the best recent interdisciplinary scholarship on states in relation to social structures, make use of theoretically engaged comparative and historical investigations to provide improved conceptualizations of states and how they operate. Each of the book's major parts presents a related set of analytical issues about modern states, which are explored in the context of a wide range of times and places, both contemporary and historical, and in developing and advanced-industrial nations. The first part examines state strategies in newly developing countries. The second part analyzes war making and state making in early modern Europe, and discusses states in relation to the post-World War II international economy. The third part pursues new insights into how states influence political cleavages and collective action. In the final chapter, the editors bring together the questions raised by the contributors and suggest tentative conclusions that emerge from an overview of all the articles. As a programmatic work that proposes new directions for the analysis of modern states, the volume will appeal to a wide range of teachers and students of political science, political economy, sociology, history, and anthropology.","1985-09-13","2022-06-28 14:37:51","2022-06-28 15:08:16","","","406","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: sYgTwHQbNAAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=sYgTwHQbNAAC","","Political Science / General; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Political Science / Public Policy / Social Services & Welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present work is only an attempt to disengage the major themes that seem to be of relevance to our understanding of China today. In particular, this volume studies three questions. Why did the Chinese Empire stay together when the Roman Empire, and every other empire of antiquity of the middle ages, ultimately collapsed? What were the causes of the medieval revolution which made the Chinese economy after about 1100 the most advanced in the world? And why did China after about 1350 fail to maintain her earlier pace of technological advance while still, in many respects, advancing economically? The three sections of the book deal with these problems in turn but the division of a subject matter is to some extent only one of convenience. These topics are so interrelated that, in the last analysis, none of them can be considered in isolation from the others.","1973","2022-06-28 14:33:18","2022-06-28 14:33:18","","","358","","","","","The Pattern of the Chinese Past","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 3ZGXMWnJMiEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=3ZGXMWnJMiEC","","History / Asia / China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"CWPEQ8GV","book","2009","Ellickson, Robert C.","Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes","","978-0-674-03643-7","","","","In Order without Law Robert C. Ellickson shows that law is far less important than is generally thought. He demonstrates that people largely govern themselves by means of informal rules-social norms-that develop without the aid of a state or other central coordinator. Integrating the latest scholarship in law, economics, sociology, game theory, and anthropology, Ellickson investigates the uncharted world within which order is successfully achieved without law. The springboard for Ellickson's theory of norms is his close investigation of a variety of disputes arising from the damage created by escaped cattle in Shasta County, California. In The Problem of Social Cost --the most frequently cited article on law--economist Ronald H. Cease depicts farmers and ranchers as bargaining in the shadow of the law while resolving cattle-trespass disputes. Ellickson's field study of this problem refutes many of the behavioral assumptions that underlie Coase's vision, and will add realism to future efforts to apply economic analysis to law. Drawing examples from a wide variety of social contexts, including whaling grounds, photocopying centers, and landlord-tenant relations, Ellickson explores the interaction between informal and legal rules and the usual domains in which these competing systems are employed. Order without Law firmly grounds its analysis in real-world events, while building a broad theory of how people cooperate to mutual advantage.","2009-06-30","2022-06-28 14:32:38","2022-07-04 03:46:49","","","317","","","","","Order without Law","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JJdCi_IpbKIC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=JJdCi_IpbKIC","","Law / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is now well known that China has been marked by great diversity. In the realm of social customs, not only were there broad regional or class differences, but also, at a local level, the people in one village might adopt a different set of practices from those of neighboring communities. Yet the majority of these varied practices seems to have fit within a frame that was distinctly Chinese. Thus scholars must also ask how people of dissimilar occupations and economic interests, living in widely separated parts of the country, came to recognize and act on a common set of cultural beliefs. Explaining the variations in Chinese society requires minute knowledge of local conditions. Explaining the uniformities requires historical understanding of the processes involved in the spread of ideas and practices and the ways by which some came to be considered standard. Given the available sources on Chinese society, neither of these tasks is simple. The study of kinship and kinship organizations provides one of the best ways to approach the coexisting uniformities and variations of Chinese society. This edited volume is the collaboration of historians and social scientists, and this collaboration is required if we are to learn enough about kinship in Chinese society to explain both the uniformities and the variations. The substantive papers are all written by historians, but these historians have raided the stock of anthropological terms, models, and theories, tried to use technical terms in a consistent and well-defined way, implicitly addressed anthropologists on the issues that seem to fascinate them, and responded to the suggestions and criticisms of the anthropologists who have read their papers. At the same time, however, they remain historians and do not ignore the types of issues (such as historical context and change over time) with which historians have always dealt. The editors believe that this type of collaboration has distinct advantages over the more usual approach to transcending disciplinary boundaries by placing articles by historians and social scientists side by side in the same volume. If we have been successful, social scientists should find issues of interest in the chapters, and historians should find them full of the substance of history and not too long-winded in the belaboring the obvious. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press’s mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

"4N3SZIP7","book","1993","Ebrey, Patricia Buckley","The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period","","978-0-520-91348-6","","","","The Sung Dynasty (960-1279) was a paradoxical era for Chinese women. This was a time when footbinding spread, and Confucian scholars began to insist that it was better for a widow to starve than to remarry. Yet there were also improvements in women's status in marriage and property rights. In this thoroughly original work, one of the most respected scholars of premodern China brings to life what it was like to be a woman in Sung times, from having a marriage arranged, serving parents-in-law, rearing children, and coping with concubines, to deciding what to do if widowed.Focusing on marriage, Patricia Buckley Ebrey views family life from the perspective of women. She argues that the ideas, attitudes, and practices that constituted marriage shaped women's lives, providing the context in which they could interpret the opportunities open to them, negotiate their relationships with others, and accommodate or resist those around them.Ebrey questions whether women's situations actually deteriorated in the Sung, linking their experiences to widespread social, political, economic, and cultural changes of this period. She draws from advice books, biographies, government documents, and medical treatises to show that although the family continued to be patrilineal and patriarchal, women found ways to exert their power and authority. No other book explores the history of women in pre-twentieth-century China with such energy and depth.","1993-12-01","2022-06-28 14:30:47","2022-06-28 14:30:47","","","354","","","","","The Inner Quarters","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: xjoLCgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=xjoLCgAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / General; Social Science / Gender Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leading Durkheim scholar Steve Lukes’s new introduction builds upon Lewis Coser’s original—which places the work in its intellectual and historical context and pinpoints its central ideas and arguments. Lukes explains the text’s continued significance as a tool to think about and deal with problems that face us today.

In the South, socioeconomic backwardness was matched by the persistence of traditional forms of political behaviour - a politics based primarily on personal ties and patronage rather than on broader bonds of interest or ideology. This study seeks to understand the sources of popular support for clientelism in a resource-scarce society such as southern Italy. It analyses the dynamics of continuity and change in a political system based primarily on clientelism rather than on broader bonds of interest or ideology. The author explores the concrete patronage mechanisms linking the dominant party to each of the major social groups in the city - ranging from the urban poor to the Mafia. By contrast, the sections on Naples address the question of the conditions under which political machines may have lost their mass base of support.","1982","2022-07-04 09:57:39","2022-07-12 07:26:47","","","312","","","","","Patronage, Power and Poverty in Southern Italy","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TfKb3ZmyovcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=TfKb3ZmyovcC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The operations in East Timor and Kosovo are commonly seen as unique in the history of the UN--perhaps never to be repeated. But they may also be seen as the latest in a series of operations that have involved the United Nations in 'state-building' activities, where it has attempted to develop the institutions of government by assuming some or all of those sovereign powers on a temporary basis. The circumstances that have demanded such interventions certainly will be repeated.Seen in the context of earlier UN operations, such as those in Namibia, Cambodia, and Eastern Slavonia, the view that these exceptional circumstances may not recur is somewhat disingenuous. Moreover, the need for such policy research has been brought into sharp focus by the weighty but ambiguous role assigned to the UN in Afghanistan and the possibility of a comparable role in Iraq.This book fills that gap. Aimed at policy-makers, diplomats, and a wide academic audience (including international relations, political science, international law, and war studies), the book provides a concise history of UN state-building operations and a treatment of the five key issues confronting such an operation on the ground: peace and security, the role of the UN as government, judicial reconstruction, economic reconstruction, and exit strategies.","2005","2022-07-04 09:55:28","2022-07-04 09:55:28","","","330","","","","","You, the People","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: p1Bqao_JNiMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=p1Bqao_JNiMC","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Law / International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CHFFPNAK","book","1999","Chen, Jianfu","Chinese Law: Towards an Understanding of Chinese Law, Its Nature and Developments","","978-90-411-1186-9","","","","Law, in particular its actual functioning in any given society, is above all a part of the culture of that society - a part of its historical, political, social and intellectual creation. If a black-letter' approach towards law in the West is under increasing criticism, it is particularly unhelpful, if not misleading, in understanding Chinese law, its nature and developments. Rather, to understand Chinese law, its nature and developments, we need to examine the Chinese legal traditions, the prevailing political and economic situations, Party policies on economic reform and tolerance towards political liberalisation, and scholarly discussions and debate. This is the approach of this book. Its aim is to put Chinese law in context', to outline the nature and present status of its development, and to analyse the meaning of the law within the Chinese context. However, this monograph does not ignore the practical needs for determining the precise contents of the black- letter' law either. A study of this kind necessarily involves a process of topic selection. However, to avoid over-generalisation and over-simplification, it also demands a considerable degree of comprehensiveness in coverage. For this reason, the book covers what the Chinese scholars term fundamental law' and basic branches' of law, while other topics are covered because they are either crucial for the understanding of the law (such as legal traditions in China) or of practical importance (such as foreign investment and trade). Chapter One provides an historical background to traditional Chinese legal culture' and modern law reforms. The historical background of specific topics is examined as the topics are analysed inthe following chapters. Chapter Two deals with the changing fate of law under Communist rule. Its focus is on the underlying factors and justifications for such changes. Chapter Three introduces discussions on specific branches of law, from public law (constitutional law, law-making, administrative law, criminal law, criminal procedure law) to private' law (civil law, family law, contracts, law on business entities, and law on foreign investment and trade). Each of these is dealt with in a separate chapter. After the analysis of these substantial topics, certain conclusions are drawn, which attempt to define the nature of Chinese law and its developments in present-day China.","1999-07-14","2022-07-04 09:53:52","2022-07-04 09:53:52","","","440","","","","","Chinese Law","","","","","Martinus Nijhoff Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ZelKBjdngfsC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ZelKBjdngfsC","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its work was primarily the recruitment of civil servants by fair methods, treating all qualified applicants equally, and using open competitions wherever practicable. It was held in high esteem not only in the United Kingdom but also in the many other countries throughout the world which, in many places, modelled their methods of public service recruitment on its pioneering work. It continued until 1991, when most of its work was devolved to over 3,000 government departments and executive agencies.This book describes the gestation, growth, development and eventual demise of the Commision and includes a number of in-depth case studies.

It shows how the department was formally organised and there is a particular focus on how it actually worked on a day-to-day basis.

Daniel Ziblatt revisits this timely and classic question in a wide-ranging historical narrative that traces the evolution of modern political democracy in Europe from its modest beginnings in 1830s Britain to Adolf Hitler's 1933 seizure of power in Weimar Germany. Based on rich historical and quantitative evidence, the book offers a major reinterpretation of European history and the question of how stable political democracy is achieved. The barriers to inclusive political rule, Ziblatt finds, were not inevitably overcome by unstoppable tides of socioeconomic change, a simple triumph of a growing middle class, or even by working class collective action. Instead, political democracy's fate surprisingly hinged on how conservative political parties - the historical defenders of power, wealth, and privilege - recast themselves and coped with the rise of their own radical right. With striking modern parallels, the book has vital implications for today's new and old democracies under siege.","2017-04-17","2022-07-04 09:52:03","2022-07-04 09:52:03","","","451","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: leCBDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=leCBDgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; History / Europe / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In what circumstances will the parties that formerly dominated politics in a nation or city come under attack? Shefter's work exemplifies the ""new institutionalism"" in political science, arguing that the reliance of parties on patronage is a function not so much of mass political culture as of their relationship with public bureaucracies. The book's opening chapters analyze the circumstances conducive to the emergence of strong political parties and the changing balance between parties and bureaucracies in Europe and America.

"TKAFGPZ8","book","2009","Scott, James C.","The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia","","978-0-300-15652-2","","","","For two thousand years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround them--slavery, conscription, taxes, corvee labor, epidemics, and warfare. This book, essentially an anarchist history, is the first-ever examination of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their histories and genealogies as they move between and around states. In accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history, demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and redefines state-making as a form of internal colonialism. This new perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives of the lowland states. Scott&#39;s work on Zomia represents a new way to think of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.","2009-01-01","2022-07-04 09:44:31","2022-07-04 09:44:31","","","465","","","","","The Art of Not Being Governed","","","","","Yale University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oiLYu2-uc8IC","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Science / General; Political Science / World / Asian; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Social Science / Sociology / Rural","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The New Digital Age is the product of an unparalleled collaboration: full of the brilliant insights of one of Silicon Valley's great innovators - what Bill Gates was to Microsoft and Steve Jobs was to Apple, Schmidt (along with Larry Page and Sergey Brin) was to Google - and the Director of Google Ideas, Jared Cohen, formerly an advisor to both Secretaries of State Condoleezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. Never before has the future been so vividly and transparently imagined. From technologies that will change lives (information systems that greatly increase productivity, safety and our quality of life, thought-controlled motion technology that can revolutionise medical procedures, and near-perfect translation technology that allows us to have more diversified interactions) to our most important future considerations (curating our online identity and fighting those who would do harm with it) to the widespread political change that will transform the globe (through transformations in conflict, increasingly active and global citizenries, a new wave of cyber-terrorism and states operating simultaneously in the physical and virtual realms) to the ever present threats to our privacy and security, Schmidt and Cohen outline in great detail and scope all the promise and peril awaiting us in the coming decades.

While the emphasis has shifted somewhat in the course of the writing, it is still a book about political organization, an attempt to work out a theory about the relation between organization and conflict, the relation between political organization and democracy, and the organizational alternatives open to the American people. The assumption made throughout is that the nature of political organization depends on the conflicts exploited in the political system, which ultimately is what politics is about. The thesis is that we shall never understand politics unless we know what the struggle is about. The great problem in American politics is: What makes things happen? We might understand the dynamics of American politics if we knew what is going on when things are happening. What is the process of change? What does change look like? These questions are worth asking because obviously tremendous things are going on in American public affairs, even in quiet times... To understand why Americans generally have been unconscious of the process of change it is necessary to take a new look at the dynamics of American politics. Throughout this book the emphasis has been on the dynamic character of the American political system. The concepts formulated here constitute an attack on all political theories, all research techniques and concepts tending to show that American politics is a meaningless stalemate about which no one can do anything. Because so much is going on, one object of the book is to show the need for a new public policy about politics.--from the Preface.","1975","2022-07-04 09:40:23","2022-07-04 09:40:23","","","180","","","","","The Semisovereign People","","","","","Dryden Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JPzyJyg3_tUC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=JPzyJyg3_tUC","","Political Science / American Government / State","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the United States, nearly one in every three scientists and engineers was engaged in defense-related research and development at the end of the Cold War, but the relative strength of the American economy has declined in recent years.What is the relationship between what has happened in the two countries? And where did Japan's technological excellence come from? In an economic history that will arouse controversy on both sides of the Pacific, Richard J. Samuels finds a key to Japan's success in an ideology of technological development that advances national interests.From 1868 until 1945, the Japanese economy was fired by the development of technology to enhance national security; the rallying cry ""Rich Nation, Strong Army"" accompanied the expanded military spending and aggressive foreign policy that led to the disasters of the War in the Pacific. Postwar economic planners reversed the assumptions that had driven Japan's industrialization, Samuels shows, promoting instead the development of commercial technology and infrastructure. By valuing process improvements as much as product innovation, the modern Japanese system has built up the national capacity to innovate while ensuring that technological advances have been diffused broadly through industries such as aerospace that have both civilian and military applications.Struggling with the uncertainties of a post-Cold War economy, the United States has important lessons to learn from the way Japan has subordinated defense production yet emerged as one of the most technologically sophisticated nations in the world. The Japanese, like the Venetians and the Dutch before them, show us that butter is just as likely as guns to make a nation strong, but that nations cannot hope to be strong without an ideology of technological development that nourishes the entire national economy.","2018-08-06","2022-07-04 09:39:22","2022-07-04 09:39:22","","","473","","","","","""Rich Nation, Strong Army""","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5JNlDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=5JNlDwAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / Japan; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Security (National & International); Political Science / Political Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is usually considered to be a particularly Republican phenomenon, which declined as other mechanisms developed with the growth of the imperial bureaucracy. Dr Saller's book, the first major study of patronage in the early Empire, shows that the patron-client relationship continued on much the same basis into the third century AD. Drawing on literary and epigraphic sources, he examines the language and ideology of the patron-client exchange, and then investigates how the exchange functioned in the political, economic and social life of the Roman world from the imperial court to the subjects in the provinces. A case study of North Africa illustrates the importance of patronage relationships in a province which produced many members of the new bureaucracy and also eventually an emperor, with consequences for the range of patronage bonds.","2002-05-09","2022-07-04 09:38:53","2022-07-04 09:38:53","","","238","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=E7RayowC-IQC","","History / World; History / Ancient / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"7RBJJ2LY","book","2001","Sachs, Jeffrey","Tropical Underdevelopment","","","","","","Abstract: Most recent cross-country analyses of economic growth have neglected the importance of physical geography. This paper reviews the distinctive development challenges faced by economies situated in tropical climates. Using geographic information system (GIS) mapping, the paper presents evidence that production technology in the tropics has lagged behind temperate zone technology in the two critical areas of agriculture and health, and this in turn opened a substantial income gap between climate zones. The difficulty of mobilizing energy resources in tropical economies is emphasized as another significant contributor to the income gap. These factors have been amplified by geopolitical power imbalances and by the difficulty of applying temperate-zone technological advances in the tropical setting. The income gap has also been amplified because poor public health and weak agricultural technology in the tropics have combined to slow the demographic transition from high fertility and mortality rates to low fertility and mortality rates. The analysis suggests that economic development in tropical ecozones would benefit from a concerted international effort to develop health and agricultural technologies specific to the needs of the tropical economies.","2001","2022-07-04 09:38:24","2022-07-04 09:38:24","","","34","","","","","","","","","","National Bureau of Economic Research","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Q9tYnQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Q9tYnQEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Richard Stone traces the radical change in the ICC's view of the rail industry, from the maximum control it exercised for many years through the unilateral deregulation that was begun in 1978. He considers the forces and pressures that contributed to the Commission's actions, including Congress, the president, the railroads, rail shippers, and academicians.The book begins with two chapters that survey the history of the ICC and rail regulation through the mid-1970s. Stone then turns to the events of 1976, when the seeds of deregulation were sown with the election of Jimmy Carter and the passage of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform (4R) Act. Subsequent chapters cover the years between the 4R Act and the Staggers Act, which were characterized by the Commission's changing attitude toward rail regulation; the background and provisions of the 1980 Staggers Act and the events that followed it; and the recent events and changes in philosophy that have taken place at the ICC with regard to the rail industry. This study, the first to be published on the ICC since 1976, follows that body's transformation from a powerful independent commission to a much smaller and less influential institution. The work will be a valuable resource for students of public policy, transportation studies, and political science.","1991","2022-07-04 09:37:06","2022-07-04 09:37:06","","","240","","","","","The Interstate Commerce Commission and the Railroad Industry","","","","","Praeger","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: f_ewAAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=f_ewAAAAIAAJ","","Business & Economics / Economic History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why is it acceptable for parties to try to win elections by promising to make certain groups of people better off, but unacceptable - and illegal - to pay people for their votes? Why do parties often lavish benefits on loyal voters, whose support they can count on anyway, rather than on responsive swing voters? Why is vote buying and machine politics common in today's developing democracies but a thing of the past in most of today's advanced democracies? This book develops a theory of broker-mediated distribution to answer these questions, testing the theory with research from four developing democracies, and reviews a rich secondary literature on countries in all world regions. The authors deploy normative theory to evaluate whether clientelism, pork-barrel politics, and other non-programmatic distributive strategies can be justified on the grounds that they promote efficiency, redistribution, or voter participation.","2013-09-23","2022-07-04 09:36:13","2022-07-04 09:36:13","","","343","","","","","Brokers, Voters, and Clientelism","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: PdiaAAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=PdiaAAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book asserts that not all warlords are created equal. Under certain conditions, some become effective governors on behalf of the state. This provocative argument is based on extensive fieldwork in Afghanistan, where Mukhopadhyay examined warlord-governors who have served as valuable exponents of the Karzai regime in its struggle to assert control over key segments of the countryside. She explores the complex ecosystems that came to constitute provincial political life after 2001 and exposes the rise of 'strongman' governance in two provinces. While this brand of governance falls far short of international expectations, its emergence reflects the reassertion of the Afghan state in material and symbolic terms that deserve our attention. This book pushes past canonical views of warlordism and state building to consider the logic of the weak state as it has arisen in challenging, conflict-ridden societies like Afghanistan.","2014-02-13","2022-07-04 09:21:01","2022-07-04 09:21:01","","","387","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: mYx2AgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=mYx2AgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Law / Comparative; Law / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sidel provides an alternate vantage point for understanding the variegated forms and trajectories of revolution across the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam, a perspective that is de-nationalized, internationalized, and transnationalized. Sidel positions this new vantage point against the conventional framing of revolutions in modern Southeast Asian history in terms of a nationalist template, on the one hand, and distinctive local cultures and forms of consciousness, on the other. Sidel's comparative analysis shows how—in very different, decisive, and often surprising ways—the Philippine, Indonesian, and Vietnamese revolutions were informed, enabled, and impelled by diverse cosmopolitan connections and international conjunctures. Sidel addresses the role of Freemasonry in the making of the Philippine revolution, the importance of Communism and Islam in Indonesia's Revolusi, and the influence that shifting political currents in China and anticolonial movements in Africa had on Vietnamese revolutionaries. Through this assessment, Republicanism, Communism, and Islam tracks how these forces, rather than nationalism per se, shaped the forms of these revolutions, the ways in which they unfolded, and the legacies which they left in their wakes.","2021-05-15","2022-07-04 09:20:44","2022-07-04 09:20:44","","","324","","","","","Republicanism, Communism, Islam","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: WzIAEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=WzIAEAAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / Southeast Asia; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Nationalism & Patriotism; Religion / Islam / History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But scams are also a central part of Nigeria's domestic cultural landscape. Corruption is so widespread in Nigeria that its citizens call it simply ""the Nigerian factor."" Willing or unwilling participants in corruption at every turn, Nigerians are deeply ambivalent about it--resigning themselves to it, justifying it, or complaining about it. They are painfully aware of the damage corruption does to their country and see themselves as their own worst enemies, but they have been unable to stop it. A Culture of Corruption is a profound and sympathetic attempt to understand the dilemmas average Nigerians face every day as they try to get ahead--or just survive--in a society riddled with corruption. Drawing on firsthand experience, Daniel Jordan Smith paints a vivid portrait of Nigerian corruption--of nationwide fuel shortages in Africa's oil-producing giant, Internet cafés where the young launch their e-mail scams, checkpoints where drivers must bribe police, bogus organizations that siphon development aid, and houses painted with the fraud-preventive words ""not for sale."" This is a country where ""419""--the number of an antifraud statute--has become an inescapable part of the culture, and so universal as a metaphor for deception that even a betrayed lover can say, ""He played me 419."" It is impossible to comprehend Nigeria today--from vigilantism and resurgent ethnic nationalism to rising Pentecostalism and accusations of witchcraft and cannibalism--without understanding the role played by corruption and popular reactions to it.Some images inside the book are unavailable due to digital copyright restrictions.","2010-12-16","2022-07-04 09:20:23","2022-07-04 09:20:23","","","290","","","","","A Culture of Corruption","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 3fPI7YmOaS8C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=3fPI7YmOaS8C","","Social Science / Regional Studies; Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Political Science / Political Process / General; History / Africa / West","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It examines the reconstruction of institutional power relationships that had to be negotiated among the courts, the parties, the president, the Congress and the states in order to accommodate the expansion of national administrative capacities around the turn of the twentieth century. Stephen Skowronek argues that new institutional forms and procedures do not arise reflexively or automatically in response to environmental demands on government, but must be extorted through political and institutional struggles that are rooted in and mediated by pre-established governing arrangements.

But Moore is not ultimately concerned with explaining economic development so much as exploring why modes of development produced different political forms that managed the transition to industrialism and modernization. Why did one society modernize into a ""relatively free,"" democratic society (by which Moore means England)? Why did others metamorphose into fascist or communist states? His core thesis is that in each country, the relationship between the landlord class and the peasants was a primary influence on the ultimate form of government the society arrived at upon arrival in its modern age. “Throughout the book, there is the constant play of a mind that is scholarly, original, and imbued with the rarest gift of all, a deep sense of human reality . . .

Starting in the 16th century with the English enclosures and ending with the World Bank's recent attempt to reform Cambodian land law - while moving through 19th century America, postwar Japan, and contemporary China - Upham dismantles the virtually unchallenged assertion that growth cannot occur without stable legal property rights, and shows how rapid growth can come only through the destruction of pre-existing property structures and their replacement by more productive ones. He argues persuasively for the replacement of Western myths and theoretical simplifications with nuanced approaches to growth and development that are sensitive to complexity and difference and responsive to the political and social factors essential to successful broad-based development.","2018-02","2022-07-04 07:10:09","2022-07-04 07:10:09","","","165","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 3qpCDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=3qpCDwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Law / Comparative; Law / General; Law / Commercial / International Trade; Law / Property","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, he picks up the thread again in the second instalment of his definitive account of mankind's emergence as a political animal.This is the story of how state, law and democracy developed after these cataclysmic events, how the modern landscape - with its uneasy tension between dictatorships and liberal democracies - evolved and how in the United States and in other developed democracies, unmistakable signs of decay have emerged. If we want to understand the political systems that dominate and order our lives, we must first address their origins - in our own recent past as well as in the earliest systems of human government. Fukuyama argues that the key to successful government can be reduced to three key elements: a strong state, the rule of law and institutions of democratic accountability.This magisterial account is required reading for anyone wishing to know more about mankind's greatest achievements.","2014-09-25","2022-07-04 07:01:23","2022-07-04 07:01:23","","","697","","","","","Political Order and Political Decay","","","","","Profile Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Rj-eAwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Geopolitics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For a hundred years and more after the Revolution, millions of peasants lived on as if in a timeless world, their existence little different from that of the generations before them.  The author of this lively, often witty, and always provocative work traces how France underwent a veritable crisis of civilization in the early years of the French Republic as traditional attitudes and practices crumbled under the forces of modernization. Local roads and railways were the decisive factors, bringing hitherto remote and inaccessible regions into easy contact with markets and major centers of the modern world. The products of industry rendered many peasant skills useless, and the expanding school system taught not only the language of the dominant culture but its values as well, among them patriotism. By 1914, France had finally become La Patrie in fact as it had so long been in name.","1976","2022-07-04 06:15:41","2022-07-04 06:15:41","","","631","","","","","Peasants Into Frenchmen","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4KnC4ROsiwwC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4KnC4ROsiwwC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The transformations along these three dimensions density, distance, and division are most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, but countries in Asia and Eastern Europe are changing in ways similar in scope and speed. 'World Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography' concludes that these spatial transformations are essential, and should be encouraged. The conclusion is not without controversy. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. Globalization is believed to benefit many, but not the billion people living in lagging areas of developing nations. High poverty and mortality persist among the world's 'bottom billion', while others grow wealthier and live longer lives. Concern for these three billion often comes with the prescription that growth must be made spatially balanced. The WDR has a different message: economic growth is seldom balanced, and efforts to spread it out prematurely will jeopardize progress. The Report: documents how production becomes more concentrated spatially as economies grow. proposes economic integration as the principle for promoting successful spatial transformations. revisits the debates on urbanization, territorial development, and regional integration and shows how today's developers can reshape economic geography.","2008-11-04","2022-07-04 06:08:42","2022-07-04 06:08:42","","","410","","","","","World Development Report 2009","","","","","World Bank Publications","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ZkDE5CxAqHcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ZkDE5CxAqHcC","","Political Science / Globalization; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Political Science / Public Policy / Regional Planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He draws a distinction between slavery as a form of work organization—the aspect that has dominated historical debates—and slavery as a set of property rights. Slave-based commerce remained central to the eighteenth-century rise of the Atlantic economy, not because slave plantations were superior as a method of organizing production, but because slaves could be put to work on sugar plantations that could not have attracted free labor on economically viable terms.","2013-02-18","2022-07-04 06:01:28","2022-07-04 06:01:28","","","188","","","","","","","","","","LSU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4O_qcIBxJ0IC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4O_qcIBxJ0IC","","Business & Economics / Economic History; History / United States / State & Local / South (AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, VA, WV); Social Science / Slavery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"RIH94ZHB","book","2009","Wrong, Michela","It’s Our Turn to Eat","","978-0-00-732511-5","","","","A gripping account of both an individual caught on the horns of an excruciating moral dilemma and a continent at a turning point. When Michela Wrong's Kenyan friend John Githongo appeared one cold February morning on the doorstep of her London flat, carrying a small mountain of luggage and four trilling mobile phones he seemed determined to ignore, it was clear something had gone very wrong in a country regarded until then as one of Africa's few budding success stories. Two years earlier, in the wave of euphoria that followed the election defeat of long-serving President Daniel arap Moi, John had been appointed Kenya's new anti-corruption czar. In choosing this giant of a man with a booming laugh, respected as a longstanding anti-corruption crusader, the new government was signalling to both its own public and the world at large that it was set on ending the practices that had made Kenya an international by-word for sleaze. Now John was on the run, having realised that the new administration, far from breaking with the past, was using near-identical techniques to pilfer public funds. John's tale, which has all the elements of the political thriller, is the story of how a brave man came to make a lonely decision with huge ramifications. But his story transcends the personal, touching as it does on the cultural, historical and social themes that lie at the heart of the continent's continuing crisis. Tracking this story of an African whistleblower who started out as a pillar of the establishment, Michela Wrong seeks answers to the questions that have puzzled outsiders for decades. What is it about African society that makes corruption so hard to eradicate, so sweeping in its scope, so destructive in its impact? Why have so many African presidents found it so easy to reduce all political discussion to the self-serving calculation of which tribe gets to ""eat""? And at what stage will Africans start placing the wider interests of their nation ahead of the narrow interests of their tribe?","2009-04-10","2022-07-04 06:00:55","2022-07-04 06:00:55","","","35","","","","","","","","","","HarperCollins UK","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 95J3RkBG4TAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=95J3RkBG4TAC","","Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries; Political Science / Political Process / General; History / Africa / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Though still a work in progress, Yang arugues, taken together these reforms have improved the institutional environment for economic development and altered the landscape for Chinas ongoing struggle against rampant corruption. These measures are also likely to have important implications for the exercise of governmental authority and for Chinas future political development.

In a series of ten vibrant urban biographies that stretch from the shores of Puritan Boston to Dublin, Hong Kong, New Delhi, Liverpool, and beyond, acclaimed historian Tristram Hunt demonstrates that urbanism is in fact the most lasting of Britain's imperial legacies.Combining historical scholarship, cultural criticism, and personal reportage, Hunt offers a new history of empire, excavated from architecture and infrastructure, from housing and hospitals, sewers and statues, prisons and palaces. Avoiding the binary verdict of empire as ""good"" or ""bad,"" he traces the collaboration of cultures and traditions that produced these influential urban centers, the work of an army of administrators, officers, entrepreneurs, slaves, and renegades. In these ten cities, Hunt shows, we also see the changing faces of British colonial settlement: a haven for religious dissenters, a lucrative slave-trading post, a center of global hegemony.Lively, authoritative, and eye-opening, Cities of Empire makes a crucial new contribution to the history of colonialism.","2014-11-25","2022-07-04 05:43:02","2022-07-04 05:43:02","","","540","","","","","Cities of Empire","","","","","Henry Holt and Company","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6pVzAwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=6pVzAwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / Great Britain / General; Social Science / Sociology / Urban; Political Science / Colonialism & Post-Colonialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Daniel Ziblatt revisits this timely and classic question in a wide-ranging historical narrative that traces the evolution of modern political democracy in Europe from its modest beginnings in 1830s Britain to Adolf Hitler's 1933 seizure of power in Weimar Germany. Based on rich historical and quantitative evidence, the book offers a major reinterpretation of European history and the question of how stable political democracy is achieved. The barriers to inclusive political rule, Ziblatt finds, were not inevitably overcome by unstoppable tides of socioeconomic change, a simple triumph of a growing middle class, or even by working class collective action. Instead, political democracy's fate surprisingly hinged on how conservative political parties - the historical defenders of power, wealth, and privilege - recast themselves and coped with the rise of their own radical right. With striking modern parallels, the book has vital implications for today's new and old democracies under siege.","2017-04-17","2022-07-04 05:07:55","2022-07-04 05:07:55","","","451","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: leCBDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=leCBDgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; History / Europe / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YX6L4YCZ","book","1992","Gordon, Andrew","Labor and Imperial Democracy in Prewar Japan","","978-0-520-08091-1","","","","Labor and Imperial Democracy in Prewar Japan examines the political role played by working men and women in prewar Tokyo and offers a reinterpretation of the broader dynamics of Japan's prewar political history. Gordon argues that such phenomena as riots, labor disputes, and union organizing can best be understood as part of an early twentieth-century movement for ""imperial democracy"" shaped by the nineteenth-century drive to promote capitalism and build a modern nation and empire. When the propertied, educated leaders of this movement gained a share of power in the 1920s, they disagreed on how far to go toward incorporating working men and women into an expanded body politic. For their part, workers became ambivalent toward working within the imperial democratic system. In this context, the intense polarization of laborers and owners during the Depression helped ultimately to destroy the legitimacy of imperial democracy.Gordon suggests that the thought and behavior of Japanese workers both reflected and furthered the intense concern with popular participation and national power that has marked Japan's modern history. He points to a post-World War II legacy for imperial democracy in both the organization of the working class movement and the popular willingness to see GNP growth as an index of national glory. Importantly, Gordon shows how historians might reconsider the roles of tenant farmers, students, and female activists, for example, in the rise and transformation of imperial democracy.","1992-11-04","2022-07-11 11:15:45","2022-07-11 11:15:45","","","383","","","","","","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: hbYwDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=hbYwDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; History / Asia / Japan; History / General; History / Asia / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JHXNIL9C","book","1991","Goldstone, Jack A.","Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World","","978-0-520-91375-2","","","","What can the great crises of the past teach us about contemporary revolutions? Arguing from an exciting and original perspective, Goldstone suggests that great revolutions were the product of 'ecological crises' that occurred when inflexible political, economic, and social institutions were overwhelmed by the cumulative pressure of population growth on limited available resources. Moreover, he contends that the causes of the great revolutions of Europe—the English and French revolutions—were similar to those of the great rebellions of Asia, which shattered dynasties in Ottoman Turkey, China, and Japan.The author observes that revolutions and rebellions have more often produced a crushing state orthodoxy than liberal institutions, leading to the conclusion that perhaps it is vain to expect revolution to bring democracy and economic progress. Instead, contends Goldstone, the path to these goals must begin with respect for individual liberty rather than authoritarian movements of 'national liberation.'Arguing that the threat of revolution is still with us, Goldstone urges us to heed the lessons of the past. He sees in the United States a repetition of the behavior patterns that have led to internal decay and international decline in the past, a situation calling for new leadership and careful attention to the balance between our consumption and our resources.Meticulously researched, forcefully argued, and strikingly original, Revolutions and Rebellions in the Early Modern World is a tour de force by a brilliant young scholar.

In Mandarins of the Future: Modernization Theory in Cold War America Nils Gilman offers the first intellectual history of a movement that has had far-reaching and often unintended consequences.After a survey of the theory's origins and its role in forming America's postwar sense of global mission, Gilman offers a close analysis of the people who did the most to promote it in the United States and the academic institutions they came to dominate. He first explains how Talcott Parsons at Harvard constructed a social theory that challenged the prevailing economics-centered understanding of the modernization process, then describes the work of Edward Shils and Gabriel Almond in helping Parsonsian ideas triumph over other alternative conceptions of the development process, and finally discusses the role of Walt Rostow and his colleagues at M.I.T. in promoting modernization theory during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. By connecting modernization theory to the welfare state liberalism programs of the New Deal order, Gilman not only provides a new intellectual context for America's Third World during the Cold War, but also connects the optimism of the Great Society to the notion that American power and good intentions could stop the postcolonial world from embracing communism.","2007-02","2022-07-11 06:29:38","2022-07-11 06:29:38","","","348","","","","","Mandarins of the Future","","","","","JHU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: KQVxyfi6N3EC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=KQVxyfi6N3EC","","History / United States / 20th Century; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; History / United States / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / General; Political Science / International Relations / Diplomacy; History / Modern / 20th Century / General; Business & Economics / Urban & Regional; Business & Economics / Government & Business","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Range and flexibility characterize Alexander Gerschenkron's dynamic approach to Europe's industrial history. Connecting evolution in individual countries with their degree of economic backwardness, he presents the industrialization of the continent as a ""case of unity in diversity,"" thus offering a cogent alternative, supported by case studies, to the traditional view of industrialization as monotonous repetition of the same process from country to country. Brought together for the first time, these essays were originally published in specialized periodicals in the United States and abroad.Explaining and systematizing the elements of creative innovation in industrial history, Gerschenkron opens new paths of research and poses a number of pertinent questions for the problem of economic development in backward countries.

"SHQKSQAA","book","1996","Geddes, Barbara","Politician's Dilemma: Building State Capacity in Latin America","","978-0-520-20762-2","","","","In Latin America as elsewhere, politicians routinely face a painful dilemma: whether to use state resources for national purposes, especially those that foster economic development, or to channel resources to people and projects that will help insure political survival and reelection. While politicians may believe that a competent state bureaucracy is intrinsic to the national good, political realities invariably tempt leaders to reward powerful clients and constituents, undermining long-term competence. Politician's Dilemma explores the ways in which political actors deal with these contradictory pressures and asks the question: when will leaders support reforms that increase state capacity and that establish a more meritocratic and technically competent bureaucracy?Barbara Geddes brings rational choice theory to her study of Brazil between 1930 and 1964 and shows how state agencies are made more effective when they are protected from partisan pressures and operate through merit-based recruitment and promotion strategies. Looking at administrative reform movements in other Latin American democracies, she traces the incentives offered politicians to either help or hinder the process.In its balanced insight, wealth of detail, and analytical rigor, Politician's Dilemma provides a powerful key to understanding the conflicts inherent in Latin American politics, and to unlocking possibilities for real political change.","1996-09-26","2022-07-11 06:28:03","2022-07-11 06:28:03","","","262","","","","","Politician's Dilemma","","","","","University of California Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: S7cwDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=S7cwDwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / General; History / Latin America / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HLGJZYA4","book","1996","Gambetta, Diego","The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection","","978-0-674-80742-6","","","","Blood ceremonies, obscure symbols, elaborate codes, brutal executions: the arcane remnants of a defunct culture? The Mafia, this book suggests, is not nearly as bizarre as all that, not nearly as remote as we might think. In fact, as Diego Gambetta's analysis unfolds, the Mafia begins to resemble any other business. In a society where trust is in short supply, this business sells protection, a guarantee of safe conduct for commercial and social transactions. It grudgingly shares the market with other concerns like itself, of which it is merely the most successful. The author develops his elegant economic theory with ample evidence, much of it based on the remarkable work done by Judge Giovanni Falcone and his colleagues in Palermo and Agrigento in the 1980s. Drawing on the confessions of eight Mafiosi and the trials their revelations triggered, Gambetta is able to explain all manner of peculiar Mafia marketing strategies that have been endlessly misinterpreted in the past. He makes illuminating - and unexpected - comparisons between the business of protection and ordinary industries, such as automotive insurance, and advertising. And he teases out the subtle distinctions between protection and extortion, in which the protector himself poses a threat. This new approach reshapes traditional interpretations of the Mafia - its origins, functions, and social consequences. Applying informal economic analysis, Gambetta shows how such a recognized evil can perform a real service, and how such a recognizable service can inflict great harm on a society.","1996-02","2022-07-11 06:27:03","2022-07-11 06:27:03","","","350","","","","","The Sicilian Mafia","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: y3bv3tqWftYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=y3bv3tqWftYC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Social Science / Criminology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"WL9AQH3T","book","1981","Furet, François","Interpreting the French Revolution","","978-0-521-28049-5","","","","The French Revolution is an historical event unlike any other. It is more than just a topic of intellectual interest: it has become part of a moral and political heritage. But after two centuries, this central event in French history has usually been thought of in much the same terms as it was by its contemporaries. There have been many accounts of the French Revolution, and though their opinions differ, they have often been commemorative or anniversary interpretations of the original event. The dividing line of revolutionary historiography, in intellectual terms, is therefore not between the right and the left, but between commemorative and conceptual history, as exemplified respectively in the works of Michelet and Tocquevifle. In this book, François Furet analyses how an event like the French Revolution can be conceptualised, and identifies the radically new changes the Revolution produced as well as the continuity it provided, albeit under the appearance of change. This question has become a riddle for the European left, answered neither by Marx nor by the theorists of our own century. In his analysis of the tragic relevance of the Revolution, Furet both refers to contemporary experience and discusses various elements in the work of Alexis de Tocclueville and that of Augustin Cochin, which has never been systematically applied by historians of the Revolution. Furet's book is based on the complementary ideas of these two writers in an attempt to cut through the apparent and misleading clarity of various contradictory views of the Revolution, and to help decipher some of the enigmatic problems of revolutionary ideology. It will be of value to historians of modern Europe and their students; to political, social and economic historians; to sociologists; and to students of political thought.","1981-09-24","2022-07-11 06:24:04","2022-07-11 06:24:04","","","220","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: rLFxhlSHNDYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=rLFxhlSHNDYC","","History / Europe / General; History / Modern / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"IP3F7RDS","book","2011","Fukuyama, Francis","Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States","","978-0-19-983099-2","","","","In 1700, Latin America and British North America were roughly equal in economic terms. Yet over the next three centuries, the United States gradually pulled away from Latin America, and today the gap between the two is huge. Why did this happen? Was it culture? Geography? Economic policies? Natural resources? Differences in political development? The question has occupied scholars for decades, and the debate remains a hot one. In Falling Behind, Francis Fukuyama gathers together some of the world's leading scholars on the subject to explain the nature of the gap and how it came to be. Tracing the histories of development over the past four hundred years and focusing in particular on the policies of the last fifty years, the contributors conclude that while many factors are important, economic policies and political systems are at the root of the divide. While the gap is deeply rooted in history, there have been times when it closed a bit as a consequence of policies chosen in places ranging from Chile to Argentina. Bringing to light these policy success stories, Fukuyama and the contributors offer a way forward for Latin American nations and improve their prospects for economic growth and stable political development. Given that so many attribute the gap to either vast cultural differences or the consequences of U.S. economic domination, Falling Behind is sure to stir debate. And, given the pressing importance of the subject in light of economic globalization and the immigration debate, its expansive, in-depth portrait of the hemisphere's development will be a welcome intervention in the conversation.","2011-08-25","2022-07-11 06:23:39","2022-07-11 06:23:39","","","442","","","","","Falling Behind","","","","","OUP USA","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: otzPuIB9QYYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=otzPuIB9QYYC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies); Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / International Relations / General; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; History / Latin America / General; History / United States / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"VT58FFPF","book","1999","Fukuyama, Francis; Fukuyama, Professor of International Political Economy Francis","The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstitution of Social Order","","978-0-684-84530-2","","","","Francis Fukuyama is one of America's most astute and original thinkers, and his books have opened new perspectives on the changing world around us. In The End of History and the Last Man, he was the first to glimpse the emerging shape of the post-Cold War world. In Trust, he analyzed the social factors that create prosperity and explored how they can best be harnessed. Now, in his most provocative and far-reaching book, Fukuyama turns his attention to even more fundamental questions about the nature of modern society. The Great Disruption begins by observing that over the past thirty years, the United States and other developed countries have undergone a profound transformation from industrial to information societies; knowledge has replaced mass production as the basis of wealth, power, and social interaction. At the same time; Western societies have endured increasing levels of crime, massive changes in fertility and family structure, decreasing levels of trust, and the triumph of individualism over community. Just as the Industrial Revolution brought about momentous changes in society's moral values, a similar Great Disruption in our own time has caused profound changes in our social structure. Drawing on the latest sociological data and new theoretical models from fields as diverse as economics and biology, Fukuyama reveals that even though the old order has broken apart, a new social order is already taking shape. Part of human nature, he shows, is the fact that we are all biologically hard wired to forge bonds with one another, creating social cohesion in new and adaptive forms, not only in our neighborhoods but also in our business organizations and family structures. Indeed, he suggests, the Great Disruption of the 1960s and 1970s may be giving way to a Great Reconstruction, as Western society weaves a new fabric of social and moral values appropriate to the changed realities of the postindustrial world. The cycle of disruption and reconstruction is a familiar one in human history, and in pointing us toward the future, Francis Fukuyama challenges our assumptions about society and culture and opens up a new world of possibility. Breathtaking in its scope, The Great Disruption is an indispensable guide for how to think about the millennium about to dawn.","1999","2022-07-11 06:22:27","2022-07-11 06:22:27","","","376","","","","","The Great Disruption","","","","","Free Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: WU25AAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=WU25AAAAIAAJ","","Political Science / Civil Rights; Social Science / Anthropology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Trust, a penetrating assessment of the emerging global economic order ""after History,"" he explains the social principles of economic life and tells us what we need to know to win the coming struggle for world dominance.Challenging orthodoxies of both the left and right, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures in order to divine the underlying principles that foster social and economic prosperity. Insisting that we cannot divorce economic life from cultural life, he contends that in an era when social capital may be as important as physical capital, only those societies with a high degree of social trust will be able to create the flexible, large-scale business organizations that are needed to compete in the new global economy.A brilliant study of the interconnectedness of economic life with cultural life, Trust is also an essential antidote to the increasing drift of American culture into extreme forms of individualism, which, if unchecked, will have dire consequences for the nation's economic health.","1996-06-18","2022-07-11 06:20:16","2022-07-11 06:20:16","","","560","","","","","Trust","","","","","Simon and Schuster","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: j0LC6XZtH84C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=j0LC6XZtH84C","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; History / Social History; Political Science / History & Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robert H. Frank and Philip J. Cook argue that behind this shift lies the spread of ""winner-take-all markets""—markets in which small differences in performance give rise to enormous differences in reward. Long familiar in sports and entertainment, this payoff pattern has increasingly permeated law, finance, fashion, publishing, and other fields. The result: in addition to the growing gap between rich and poor, we see important professions like teaching and engineering in aching need of more talent. This relentless emphasis on coming out on top—the best-selling book, the blockbuster film, the Super Bowl winner—has molded our discourse in ways that many find deeply troubling.","1995","2022-07-11 06:02:13","2022-07-11 06:02:13","","","292","","","","","The Winner-Take-All Society","","","","","Penguin Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: nWFtL7WS5WwC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=nWFtL7WS5WwC","","Business & Economics / Economic History; Social Science / Social Classes & Economic Disparity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question seems absurd. Darwin, after all, was a naturalist, not an economist. But Robert Frank, New York Times economics columnist and best-selling author of The Economic Naturalist, predicts that within the next century Darwin will unseat Smith as the intellectual founder of economics. The reason, Frank argues, is that Darwin's understanding of competition describes economic reality far more accurately than Smith's. And the consequences of this fact are profound. Indeed, the failure to recognize that we live in Darwin's world rather than Smith's is putting us all at risk by preventing us from seeing that competition alone will not solve our problems.Smith's theory of the invisible hand, which says that competition channels self-interest for the common good, is probably the most widely cited argument today in favor of unbridled competition—and against regulation, taxation, and even government itself. But what if Smith's idea was almost an exception to the general rule of competition? That's what Frank argues, resting his case on Darwin's insight that individual and group interests often diverge sharply. Far from creating a perfect world, economic competition often leads to ""arms races,"" encouraging behaviors that not only cause enormous harm to the group but also provide no lasting advantages for individuals, since any gains tend to be relative and mutually offsetting.The good news is that we have the ability to tame the Darwin economy. The best solution is not to prohibit harmful behaviors but to tax them. By doing so, we could make the economic pie larger, eliminate government debt, and provide better public services, all without requiring painful sacrifices from anyone. That's a bold claim, Frank concedes, but it follows directly from logic and evidence that most people already accept.In a new afterword, Frank further explores how the themes of inequality and competition are driving today's public debate on how much government we need.","2012-09-16","2022-07-11 06:01:52","2022-07-11 06:01:52","","","264","","","","","The Darwin Economy","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: DAvtiW6TDbYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=DAvtiW6TDbYC","","Political Science / General; Business & Economics / Economics / Theory; Political Science / Political Economy; Business & Economics / Economic History; Business & Economics / Economics / Macroeconomics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a history of American folkways as they have changed through time, and it argues a thesis about the importance for the United States ofhaving been British in its cultural origins. While most people in the United States today have no British ancestors, they have assimilated regional cultures which were created by British colonists, even while preserving ethnic identities at the same time. In this sense, nearly all Americans are Albion's Seed, no matter what their ethnicitymay be. The concluding section of this remarkable book explores the ways that regional cultures have continued to dominate national politics from 1789 to 1988, and still help to shape attitudes toward education, government, gender, and violence, on which differences between American regions aregreater than between European nations.","1989","2022-07-11 06:00:09","2022-07-11 06:00:09","","","981","","","","","Albion's Seed","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: GOYg58I7g30C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=GOYg58I7g30C","","History / United States / Colonial Period (1600-1775); Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social; Social Science / Folklore & Mythology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Actual political practice suggests that parties are crucial actors in democratic elections, yet the nature and extent to which parties are regulated, or even recognized, as participants in the electoral process varies greatly among nations. Author Anika Gauja analyzes the electoral laws of five key common law democracies with similar parliamentary and representative traditions, similar levels of economic and political development, yet with significantly different electoral provisions: the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Using the relationship between law and politics as a lens, the book focuses specifically on the ways in which these jurisdictions seek to regulate the behavior of their political parties as the product of a broader normative vision of how representative democracy ought to function. In its subject matter, comparative scope, and interdisciplinary theoretical framework, this book examines not only electoral law but also ancillary legislation such as funding regulations, associations and corporations law, and constitutional provisions. It also analyzes the case law that guides the interpretation of this legislation. Political Parties and Elections represents an innovative body of research, comparing for the first time the electoral-legal regimes of a significant number of common law nations.","2013-02-28","2022-07-11 05:54:20","2022-07-11 05:54:20","","","238","","","","","Political Parties and Elections","","","","","Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0IZ6BgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0IZ6BgAAQBAJ","","Law / Election Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes critical assessments of the work of Clifford Geertz, O.W.

He employs a wide range of contemporary scholarship, as well as Southeast Asian literary and historical texts, inscriptions, and temples to explore the kinds of concepts and practices--kinship networks, cosmologies, gender identities, bureaucracies, rituals, violence and aesthetics--that have been used for centuries to build states.Highly readable and accessibly written, Fluid Iron demonstrates that Southeast Asian state building has taken place in a part of the world that has always been a crossroads of cultural and transcultural change.

Sixty years later, his grandfather helped craft Nigeria's constitution and negotiate its independence, the first of its kind in Africa. Four decades later, Peter Cunliffe-Jones arrived as a journalist in the capital, Lagos, just as military rule ended, to face the country his family had a hand in shaping.Part family memoir, part history, My Nigeria is a piercing look at the colonial legacy of an emerging power in Africa. Marshalling his deep knowledge of the nation's economic, political, and historic forces, Cunliffe-Jones surveys its colonial past and explains why British rule led to collapse at independence. He also takes an unflinching look at the complicated country today, from email hoaxes and political corruption to the vast natural resources that make it one of the most powerful African nations; from life in Lagos's virtually unknown and exclusive neighborhoods to the violent conflicts between the numerous tribes that make up this populous African nation. As Nigeria celebrates five decades of independence, this is a timely and personal look at a captivating country that has yet to achieve its great potential.","2010-09-14","2022-07-11 03:45:24","2022-07-11 03:45:24","","","256","","","","","My Nigeria","","","","","St. Martin's Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: DusAwQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=DusAwQEACAAJ","","History / Africa / West; Biography & Autobiography / Editors, Journalists, Publishers; History / Military / Civil Wars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Certainly, the multidecade stagnation is not yet over. How will we get out of this mess? One political party tries to increase government spending even when we have no good plan for paying for ballooning programs like Medicare and Social Security. The other party seems to think tax cuts will raise revenue and has a record of creating bigger fiscal disasters that the first. Where does this madness come from? As Cowen argues, our economy has enjoyed low-hanging fruit since the seventeenth century: free land, immigrant labor, and powerful new technologies. But during the last forty years, the low-hanging fruit started disappearing, and we started pretending it was still there. We have failed to recognize that we are at a technological plateau. The fruit trees are barer than we want to believe. That's it. That is what has gone wrong and that is why our politics is crazy. In The Great Stagnation, Cowen reveals the underlying causes of our past prosperity and how we will generate it again. This is a passionate call for a new respect of scientific innovations that benefit not only the powerful elites, but humanity as a whole.","2011-01-25","2022-07-11 03:36:15","2022-07-11 03:36:15","","","110","","","","","The Great Stagnation","","","","","Penguin","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: tHMNnGFVFQYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=tHMNnGFVFQYC","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Economics / Macroeconomics; Business & Economics / Forecasting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the beginning of the century, the economy grew at a sustained rate, a modern transport system united the country, a massive influx of immigrants populated the land and education expanded, leading to a dramatic fall in illiteracy. However, by the second half of the century, growth not only stalled, but a dramatic reversal occurred, and the perspectives in the median and long term turned negative, and growth eventually collapsed. This work of historical analysis defines the most important problems faced by the Argentine economy. Some of these problems were fundamental, while others occurred without being properly considered, but in their entirety, Cortés Conde demonstrates how they had a deleterious effect on the country.","2013-08-22","2022-07-11 03:35:36","2022-07-11 03:35:36","","","406","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: l0zenAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=l0zenAEACAAJ","","History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies); Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General; History / Modern / 20th Century / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a vast work, necessarily more suited to the scholar and research worker than the general reader. This paperback version, abridged and re-written by Colin Ronan, makes this extremely important study accessible to a wider public. The present book covers the material treated in volumes I and II of Dr Needham's original work. The reader is introduced to the country of China, its history, geography and language, and an account is given of how scientific knowledge travelled between China and Europe. The major part of the book is then devoted to the history of scientific thought in China itself. Beginning with ancient times, it describes the milieu in which arose the schools of the Confucians, Taoists, Mohists, Logicians and Legalists. We are thus brought on to the fundamental ideas which dominated scientific thinking in the Chinese Middle Ages, to the doctrines of the Two Forces (Yin and Yang) and the Five Elements (wu hsing), to the impact of the sceptical tradition and Buddhist and Neo-Confucian thought.--Publisher description.","1978","2022-07-12 07:02:36","2022-07-12 07:02:36","","","388","","","","","The Shorter Science and Civilisation in China","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eNXGT2ag-6EC","","Science / History; Technology & Engineering / History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"JNK3N9WU","book","2006","Dittmer, Lowell; Liu, Guoli","China's Deep Reform: Domestic Politics in Transition","","978-0-7425-7317-8","","","","China's rapid and complex political and socioeconomic changes provide fertile ground for pioneering analysis, but they also present daunting theoretical and practical challenges. This reader takes up the challenge, offering the most comprehensive assessment of Chinese domestic politics available by bringing together the best recent scholarship in the field. The anthology focuses on the origin, content, and significance of the post-1989 phase of China's reform and opening to the world, commonly known in the PRC as ""deep reform."" This period has been unfolding in interaction with globalization, marketization, privatization, political institutionalization, as well as with financial and legal changes. Deep reform includes new policy initiatives that have penetrated political, legal, economic, and social sectors untouched by previous initiatives as reformers have been forced to deal with the consequences—intended and unintended—of earlier reforms. These carefully selected essays by leading scholars have been revised and updated for this text. In addition, a substantive introduction and conclusion place the articles in their broader context for readers new to the subject. With the successful transition of the leadership of the party, state, and military since 2002, the time is ripe for a comprehensive evaluation of China's deep reform as it enters a new stage. This timely reader will offer students, scholars, and policymakers invaluable insights into the dynamics of change in one of the world's emerging political and economic dynamos.Contributions by: Marc Blecher, Bruce J.

The emergence of factories, railroads, and gunboats propelled the West's rise to power in the nineteenth century, and the development of computers and nuclear weapons in the twentieth century secured its global supremacy. Now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, many worry that the emerging economic power of China and India spells the end of the West as a superpower. In order to understand this possibility, we need to look back in time. Why has the West dominated the globe for the past two hundred years, and will its power last?Describing the patterns of human history, the archaeologist and historian Ian Morris offers surprising new answers to both questions. It is not, he reveals, differences of race or culture, or even the strivings of great individuals, that explain Western dominance. It is the effects of geography on the everyday efforts of ordinary people as they deal with crises of resources, disease, migration, and climate. As geography and human ingenuity continue to interact, the world will change in astonishing ways, transforming Western rule in the process.Deeply researched and brilliantly argued, Why the West Rules—for Now spans fifty thousand years of history and offers fresh insights on nearly every page. The book brings together the latest findings across disciplines—from ancient history to neuroscience—not only to explain why the West came to rule the world but also to predict what the future will bring in the next hundred years.","2010-10-12","2022-07-12 06:59:33","2022-07-12 06:59:33","","","766","","","","","Why the West Rules—for Now","","","","","Farrar, Straus and Giroux","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4gFfSyXG2_wC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4gFfSyXG2_wC","","History / World; Social Science / Human Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That was on New Year’s Day, 1907, when TR, who had just won the Nobel Peace Prize, threw open the doors of the White House to the American people and shook 8,150 hands. One visitor remarked afterward, “You go to the White House, you shake hands with Roosevelt and hear him talk—and then you go home to wring the personality out of your clothes.” The rest of this book tells the story of TR’s irresistible rise to power. During the years 1858–1901, Theodore Roosevelt transformed himself from a frail, asthmatic boy into a full-blooded man. Fresh out of Harvard, he simultaneously published a distinguished work of naval history and became the fist-swinging leader of a Republican insurgency in the New York State Assembly. He chased thieves across the Badlands of North Dakota with a copy of Anna Karenina in one hand and a Winchester rifle in the other. Married to his childhood sweetheart in 1886, he became the country squire of Sagamore Hill on Long Island, a flamboyant civil service reformer in Washington, D.C., and a night-stalking police commissioner in New York City. As assistant secretary of the navy, he almost single-handedly brought about the Spanish-American War. After leading “Roosevelt’s Rough Riders” in the famous charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, he returned home a military hero, and was rewarded with the governorship of New York. In what he called his “spare hours” he fathered six children and wrote fourteen books. By 1901, the man Senator Mark Hanna called “that damned cowboy” was vice president. Seven months later, an assassin’s bullet gave TR the national leadership he had always craved.His is a story so prodigal in its variety, so surprising in its turns of fate, that previous biographers have treated it as a series of haphazard episodes. This book, the only full study of TR’s pre-presidential years, shows that he was an inevitable chief executive. “It was as if he were subconsciously aware that he was a man of many selves,” the author writes, “and set about developing each one in turn, knowing that one day he would be President of all the people.”","2010-11-24","2022-07-12 06:59:07","2022-07-12 06:59:07","","","962","","","","","","","","","","Random House Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=u-R37GQsVfgC","","Biography & Autobiography / Presidents & Heads of State; Political Science / Public Policy / General; History / Military / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But Moore is not ultimately concerned with explaining economic development so much as exploring why modes of development produced different political forms that managed the transition to industrialism and modernization. Why did one society modernize into a ""relatively free,"" democratic society (by which Moore means England)? Why did others metamorphose into fascist or communist states? His core thesis is that in each country, the relationship between the landlord class and the peasants was a primary influence on the ultimate form of government the society arrived at upon arrival in its modern age. “Throughout the book, there is the constant play of a mind that is scholarly, original, and imbued with the rarest gift of all, a deep sense of human reality . . .

"VUW7W3MN","book","2018","Mokyr, Joel","The Economics of the Industrial Revolution (Routledge Revivals)","","978-1-136-66843-2","","","","In recent years, scholars from a variety of disciplines have addressed many perplexing questions about the Industrial Revolution in all its aspects. Understandably, economics has become the focal point for these efforts as professional economists have sought to resolve some of the controversies surrounding this topic. First published in 1985, this collection contains ten key essays written by leading economists on the subject of the Industrial Revolution. Among the questions discussed are the causes for the pre-eminence of Britain, the roles of the inputs for growth (capital, labor, technical progress), the importance of demand factors, the relation between agricultural progress and the Industrial Revolution, and the standard of living debate. The essays demonstrate that the application of fresh viewpoints to the literature has given us a considerable new body of data at our disposal, making it possible to test commonly held hypotheses. In addition, this new data has enabled economists to apply a more rigorous logic to the thinking about the Industrial Revolution, thus sharpening many issues heretofore blurred by slipshod methodology and internal inconsistencies.","2018-07-18","2022-07-12 06:58:02","2022-07-12 06:58:02","","","283","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: AsbADwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=AsbADwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / Great Britain / General; History / Modern / 18th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But what kind and how much of a revolution was it? And what kind of “moment” could it have been? These are just some of the larger questions among the many that economic historians continue to debate. Addressing the various interpretations and assumptions that have been attached to the concept of the Industrial Revolution, Joel Mokyr and his four distinguished contributors present and defend their views on essential aspects of the Industrial Revolution. In this revised edition, all chapters—including Mokyr's extensive introductory survey and evaluation of research in this field—are updated to consider arguments and findings advanced since the volume's initial 1993 publication. Like its predecessor, the revised edition of The British Industrial Revolution is an essential book for economic historians and, indeed, for any historian of Great Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.","1998-12-25","2022-07-12 06:52:41","2022-07-12 06:52:41","","","366","","","","","The British Industrial Revolution","","","","","Avalon Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wOEYtAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wOEYtAEACAAJ","","Business & Economics / Economics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It forwarded the project of remaking the Japanese state along technocratic and fascistic lines and creating a self-sufficient Asian bloc centered on Japan and its puppet state of Manchukuo. In Planning for Empire, Janis Mimura traces the origins and evolution of this new order and the ideas and policies of its chief architects, the reform bureaucrats. The reform bureaucrats pursued a radical, authoritarian vision of modern Japan in which public and private spheres were fused, ownership and control of capital were separated, and society was ruled by technocrats.Mimura shifts our attention away from reactionary young officers to state planners—reform bureaucrats, total war officers, new zaibatsu leaders, economists, political scientists, engineers, and labor party leaders. She shows how empire building and war mobilization raised the stature and influence of these middle-class professionals by calling forth new government planning agencies, research bureaus, and think tanks to draft Five Year industrial plans, rationalize industry, mobilize the masses, streamline the bureaucracy, and manage big business. Deftly examining the political battles and compromises of Japanese technocrats in their bid for political power and Asian hegemony, Planning for Empire offers a new perspective on Japanese fascism by revealing its modern roots in the close interaction of technology and right-wing ideology.","2011-05-02","2022-07-12 06:52:05","2022-07-12 06:52:05","","","241","","","","","Planning for Empire","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oTuZ_YBPEZYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oTuZ_YBPEZYC","","History / Asia / Japan; Political Science / Public Policy / Military Policy; History / Wars & Conflicts / World War II / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a sweeping new synthesis, Mead uncovers four distinct historical patterns in foreign policy, each exemplified by a towering figure from our past.Wilsonians are moral missionaries, making the world safe for democracy by creating international watchdogs like the U.N. Hamiltonians likewise support international engagement, but their goal is to open foreign markets and expand the economy. Populist Jacksonians support a strong military, one that should be used rarely, but then with overwhelming force to bring the enemy to its knees. Jeffersonians, concerned primarily with liberty at home, are suspicious of both big military and large-scale international projects.A striking new vision of America's place in the world, Special Providence transcends stale debates about realists vs. idealists and hawks vs. doves to provide a revolutionary, nuanced, historically-grounded view of American foreign policy.","2013-05-13","2022-07-12 06:49:24","2022-07-12 06:49:24","","","392","","","","","Special Providence","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TmlDcE0BBrsC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=TmlDcE0BBrsC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Before the ProgressiveEra most Americans lived on farms, working from before sunrise to after sundown every day except Sunday with tools that had changed very little for centuries. Just three decades later, America was utterly transformed into a diverse, urban, affluent, leisure-obsessed, teeming multitude. Thisexplosive change was accompanied by extraordinary public-spiritedness as reformers--frightened by class conflict and the breakdown of gender relations--abandoned their traditional faith in individualism and embarked on a crusade to remake other Americans in their own image. The progressives redefined the role of women, rewrote the rules of politics, banned the sale of alcohol, revolutionized marriage, and eventually whipped the nation into a frenzy for joining World War I. These colorful, ambitious battles changed the face of American culture and politics andestablished the modern liberal pledge to use government power in the name of broad social good. But the progressives, unable to deliver on all of their promises, soon discovered that Americans retained a powerful commitment to individual freedom. Ironically, the progressive movement helpedreestablish the power of conservatism and ensured that America would never be wholly liberal or conservative for generations to come. Michael McGerr's A Fierce Discontent recreates a time of unprecedented turbulence and unending fascination, showing the first American middle-class revolution. Far bolder than the New Deal of FDR or the New Frontier of JFK, the Progressive Era was a time when everything was up for grabs andperfection beckoned.","2005","2022-07-12 06:48:37","2022-07-12 06:48:37","","","422","","","","","A Fierce Discontent","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: UCFKmFPC3NAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=UCFKmFPC3NAC","","History / United States / 20th Century; History / Social History; History / United States / 19th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, this system of government has functioned for well over two centuries, even through such heated partisan conflicts as the national health-care showdown and Supreme Court nominations. In Partisan Balance, noted political scholar David Mayhew examines the unique electoral foundations of the presidency, Senate, and House of Representatives in order to provide a fresh understanding for the government's success and longstanding vitality.Focusing on the period after World War II, and the fate of legislative proposals offered by presidents from Harry Truman to George W. Bush, Mayhew reveals that the presidency, Senate, and House rest on surprisingly similar electoral bases, with little difference in their partisan textures as indexed by the presidential popular vote cast in the various constituencies. Both congressional chambers have tilted a bit Republican, and while White House legislative initiatives have fared accordingly, Mayhew shows that presidents have done relatively well in getting their major proposals enacted. Over the long haul, the Senate has not proven much more of a stumbling block than the House. Arguing that the system has developed a self-correcting impulse that leads each branch to pull back when it deviates too much from other branches, Mayhew contends that majoritarianism largely characterizes the American system. The wishes of the majority tend to nudge institutions back toward the median voter, as in the instances of legislative districting, House procedural reforms, and term limits for presidents and legislators.","2011-01-17","2022-07-12 06:47:44","2022-07-12 06:47:44","","","241","","","","","Partisan Balance","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: p3FKwKnPHHgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=p3FKwKnPHHgC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties; Political Science / American Government / National; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, its first modern constitution, the Meiji Constitution, was not enacted until comparatively recently (1889). Since then, following World War II, Japan adopted its current Constitution, the Japanese Constitution of 1946. This book is designed to explain the outline of Japan's Constitution, together with a number of its unique characteristics and to offer an historical background and context which help explain its significance. Major topics covered include the constitutional history of Japan, fundamental principles of the Constitution, the people and the Emperor, the Diet and legislative power, Cabinet and executive power, and the Judiciary and judicial power. Also discussed is the protection of fundamental human rights, individual rights - including freedom of expression,economic freedoms, and social rights - pacifism and national defence, and the constitutional amendment and reform. Although the Japanese Constitution was enacted under the strong influence of the United States Constitution, many of its features are very different. For instance the existence of an Emperor, the long dominance of a conservative party over the Government, the relatively strong power of government bureaucrats, the absence of a leadership role in the Prime Minister, the small role the judiciary play in solving constitutional disputes and the struggle over national defence. Written in an accessible style and comprehensive in content, the reader will find this account of the constitutional law of Japan both unique and stimulating.","2010-11-30","2022-07-12 06:46:30","2022-07-12 06:46:30","","","330","","","","","The Constitution of Japan","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 2hLcBAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=2hLcBAAAQBAJ","","Law / Constitutional","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He witnessed at close range a harrowing series of wars, famines, and natural disasters. In The Road to Hell he tells how CARE unwittingly assisted a Somali dictator in building a political and economic powerbase. How the UN, Save the Children, and many other nongovernmental organizations provided raw materials for ethnic factions who subsequently threatened genocidal massacres in Rwanda and Burundi. He brings firsthand reports of African farmers, Western aid workers, and corrupt politicians from many countries, joined together in a vicious circle of self-interest. Above all, he heralds an important truth: humanitarian intervention and foreign aid activity is necessarily political. It gets hijacked by powerful charities and agricultural interests. It is cynically manipulated by local strongmen to control rebellious populations. And it is the last refuge of Western colonialism. We all want to end the suffering. But our desire to alleviate suffering often stands in the way of the truth.

"BSBN8R7W","book","2014","Manion, Melanie","Retirement of Revolutionaries in China: Public Policies, Social Norms, Private Interests","","978-1-4008-6341-9","","","","In this book Melanie Manion analyzes the largest bloodless circulation of elites in history--the massive retirement of officials in the People's Republic of China. Beginning in 1978 and continuing through the 1980s, Chinese leaders in Beijing replaced millions of old cadres, including veterans of the communist revolution, with younger generations of better educated and less generalist officials. How were the elders persuaded to retire? Manion shows how a norm of age-based exit from office, historically novel in the Chinese communist setting, was engineered by top policymakers and aided by younger cadres.Manion's research combined a wide variety of sources and methods, many new to the study of Chinese politics. The author examined hundreds of party and government documents, surveyed articles in newspapers and journals, and interviewed officials in charge of supervising cadre retirement policy. She first conducted long exploratory interviews with retired cadres, and then designed questionnaires distributed to hundreds of others for quantitative analysis. Finally, to understand the viewpoints of those with the most to gain, she interviewed younger, employed cadres. The result is a rich portrayal of manipulative leadership in post-Mao China, which reveals the key role of the private interests of all the parties involved.Originally published in 1993.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Europeans, he suggests, increasingly wish to escape from the “national form” that welcomed and nourished democracy in the first place. In place of territorial democracy, which made possible liberty and self-government, Europeans have increasingly succumbed to a “confused idea of human unity” that effaces all the mediations between the individual and the “world.” In Democracy without Nations? Manent takes powerful aim at this new, distinctively European form of “democratic governance,” which neither truly represents nor governs the individuals whose rights it aims to maximize. Manent's book has implications far beyond intra-European debates about the future of European democracy. It provides the richest available reflection on the political forms that make the exercise of self-government possible. It shows that the consent of the individual must be balanced by a broader cultivation of that “communion”—both civic and religious—which informs every authentically human community. And it provides a comparative critique of the relationship between religion and politics in the Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions. Manent provocatively suggests, in fact, that the liberal state and the Christian nation go hand-in-hand. The “spiritual vacuity” that characterizes today's secular Europe, he asserts, is ultimately untenable. Europeans therefore must come to terms with the Christian character of their nations if those nations—and if the moral substance of Western liberty—is to survive.","2007","2022-07-12 06:34:21","2022-07-12 06:34:21","","","134","","","","","Democracy Without Nations?","","","","","ISI Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0ISHAAAAMAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0ISHAAAAMAAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ASJQ9U2Q","book","2018","Mamdani, Mahmood","Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late Colonialism","","978-0-691-18042-7","","","","In analyzing the obstacles to democratization in post- independence Africa, Mahmood Mamdani offers a bold, insightful account of colonialism's legacy--a bifurcated power that mediated racial domination through tribally organized local authorities, reproducing racial identity in citizens and ethnic identity in subjects. Many writers have understood colonial rule as either ""direct"" (French) or ""indirect"" (British), with a third variant--apartheid--as exceptional. This benign terminology, Mamdani shows, masks the fact that these were actually variants of a despotism. While direct rule denied rights to subjects on racial grounds, indirect rule incorporated them into a ""customary"" mode of rule, with state-appointed Native Authorities defining custom. By tapping authoritarian possibilities in culture, and by giving culture an authoritarian bent, indirect rule (decentralized despotism) set the pace for Africa; the French followed suit by changing from direct to indirect administration, while apartheid emerged relatively later. Apartheid, Mamdani shows, was actually the generic form of the colonial state in Africa. Through case studies of rural (Uganda) and urban (South Africa) resistance movements, we learn how these institutional features fragment resistance and how states tend to play off reform in one sector against repression in the other. The result is a groundbreaking reassessment of colonial rule in Africa and its enduring aftereffects. Reforming a power that institutionally enforces tension between town and country, and between ethnicities, is the key challenge for anyone interested in democratic reform in Africa.","2018-05","2022-07-12 06:34:05","2022-07-12 06:34:05","","","380","","","","","Citizen and Subject","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: pnKxDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=pnKxDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Social Science / Anthropology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

More than a billion Muslims have their lives in such matters as marriage, divorce, maintenance, paternity and the custody of children governed by certain aspects of the Shari'a, commonly known as Islamic Family Law. But as the team who have put together this resource book point out, this does not mean that identical principles apply everywhere. In fact, as the socio-cultural and historical contextualisations which precede each country's legal profile make clear, the practical application of Shari'a principles is often modified by theological differences of interpretation, particular customary practices in the country concerned, and state policy and law.This volume documents the scope and actual manner of application of Islamic Family Law worldwide. Part of its purpose is the assumption that while changing social conditions - including a commitment to certain universal human rights -- make legal reform necessary, any strategy must be based first of all on the best possible factual foundations. And secondly, since Islamic Family Law has become contested ground between conservative and fundamentalist forces on the one hand and modernist and liberal trends on the other in most Islamic countries, reform must be conceived only in realistic terms and advocated in ways that motivate and empower potential supporters working in their own communities.This work is a uniquely valuable resource for lawyers, social policymakers and scholars.

Here, Andrew MacIntyre reveals exactly how they matter in the developing world. Combining an eye for current concerns in international politics with a deep knowledge of Southeast Asia, MacIntyre explores the impact of institutions on effective governance. He examines the ""national political architecture""—the complex of rules that determine how leadership of a state is constituted and how state authority is exercised. The Power of Institutions sets out an intriguing conundrum: one well-established body of literature decries the evils of highly centralized political systems, while an equally vigorous school of thought outlines the dangers of political fragmentation. MacIntyre presents the problems associated with institutional extremes, common in developing countries, as the ""power concentration paradox."" Either extreme is likely to be associated with distinctive governance problems. MacIntyre illustrates his wider arguments by focusing on Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. He shows how their diverse political architectures influenced their responses to the Asian economic crisis and played into pressures for political reform. The Power of Institutions makes clear why the configuration of political institutions is one of the most pressing challenges in many parts of the developing world today.","2018-08-06","2022-07-12 06:32:44","2022-07-12 06:32:44","","","209","","","","","The Power of Institutions","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FJJlDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=FJJlDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; History / Asia / Southeast Asia; Political Science / Political Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Napoleon will be seen as part of the Revolution, preserving its social gains, and consecrating the triumph of the bourgeoisie. The book will steer away from the personal and heroic interpretation of the period.

But, while some ethnic communities receive generous material rewards for their political support, others receive very modest payoffs. The Price of a Vote in the Middle East examines this key - and often overlooked - component of clientelism. The author draws on elite interviews and original survey data collected during his years of field research in Lebanon and Yemen; two Arab countries in which political constituencies follow sectarian, regional, and tribal divisions. He demonstrates that voters in internally-competitive communal groups receive more, and better, payoffs for their political support than voters trapped in uncompetitive groups dominated by a single, hegemonic leader. Ultimately, politicians provide services when compelled by competitive pressures to do so, whereas leaders sheltered from competition can, and do, take their supporters for granted.","2016","2022-07-12 06:31:30","2022-07-12 06:31:30","","","256","","","","","The Price of a Vote in the Middle East","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oL-NnQAACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is time to start thinking.” —Sir Ernest Rutherford   In a book destined to spark debate among both liberals and conservatives, journalist Edward Luce advances a carefully constructed argument, backed up by interviews with key players in politics and business, that America is losing its pragmatism—and that the consequences of this may soon leave the country high and dry. Addressing the changing structure of the US economy; political polarization; the debilitating effect of the “permanent election campaign”; and problems in education and business innovation, Time to Start Thinking takes a hard look at America’s dwindling options in a world where the pace is increasingly being set elsewhere.   “A brilliant reporter who has spoken to everyone: CEOs and members of the cabinet, lobbyists and small town mayors, recent MBAs and unemployed teachers. In his acutely observed, often witty, and very humane portraits, he succeeds in converting the abstractions of economics and bringing them to life.” —Liaquat Ahamed, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Lords of Finance   “Americans need friends who will tell us what we need to hear and how to think about the troubles, many of our own making, that threaten our democracy, prosperity, and leadership in the world. We’ve got just such a friend in Ed Luce. He’s a foreign observer who has not just traveled widely in the United States but listened carefully to a wide array of our citizens.” —Strobe Talbott, president, The Brookings Institution   “In a tradition stretching back to de Tocqueville, sympathetic foreigners are often the keenest observers of American life. Edward Luce is one such person. He paints a highly disturbing picture of the state of American society, and of the total failure of American elites to come to grips with the real problems facing the country. It rises far above the current political rhetoric by its measured reliance on facts.” —Francis Fukuyama, author of Identity","2012-04-03","2022-07-12 06:31:02","2022-07-12 06:31:02","","","325","","","","","Time to Start Thinking","","","","","Open Road + Grove/Atlantic","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: mR8ZWmAZdKMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=mR8ZWmAZdKMC","","Political Science / American Government / National; Political Science / Political Economy; Political Science / Commentary & Opinion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"XXS3XJ7D","book","1999","Lubman, Stanley B.","Bird in a Cage: Legal Reform in China After Mao","","978-0-8047-4378-5","","","","Since 1979, China has been building new legal institutions made necessary by economic reforms that have reduced the role of state planning, and by the decline of Maoist totalitarianism. This book analyzes the principal legal institutions that have emerged and assesses the prospects for increasing the rule of law in China.  The book first establishes the cultural and institutional context in which legal reforms take place. It traces the main features of pre-Communist Chinese legal tradition, the drastic impact on law of thirty years of Maoist rule, and the extensive changes throughout Chinese society since Maos death, notably the rise of the local party-state at the expense of central government power. The books analysis begins with the Chinese leaderships policy toward law, identifying basic ambivalence toward law that makes the Chinese commitment to legality incomplete. It then surveys major developments, emphasizing the creation of new rights, revision of criminal law and procedure, and construction of a nascent administrative law.  The book then examines in detail dispute resolution by extrajudicial mediation and the courts. Although mediation is no longer infused with Maoism, it is still used as an instrument to maintain public order. The study of the courts examines court organization, the selection and training of judges, the rise of litigation, the critical influence of localism, and ongoing conflicts between professionalism and a continuing tendency to view the judge as a soldier of the state. The author suggests that the limited role that Chinese courts are today permitted to play combines with the organization of the judicial process and the mentality of the judiciary to make Chinese adjudication more akin to bureaucratic decision making than judging in the West.  How should the accomplishments of legal reform and the continuing obstacles to further reform affect U.S. policy toward China? The book concludes by appraising implications for U.S. policy on such issues as human rights, Chinese involvement with the World Trade Organization, and bilateral relations generally. The author argues that U.S. policy makers must neither moralize about the rule of law nor dismiss it as a concept alien to China. They must also curb both optimism and expectations that legal reform will lead to political reform. Chinese law can only grow slowly, no matter how urgently the West may desire quick progress.","1999","2022-07-11 13:16:30","2022-07-11 13:16:30","","","464","","","","","Bird in a Cage","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0k9SChVyrJwC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0k9SChVyrJwC","","Law / General; Law / International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Class Differences, Values and Political Orientations in Latin America","","","","","","Middle class values have long been perceived as drivers of social cohesion and growth. This paper investigates the relation between class (measured by position in the income distribution), values, and political orientations using comparable values surveys for six Latin American countries. The analysis finds that both a continuous measure of income and categorical measures of income-based class are robustly associated with values. Both income and class tend to display a similar association to values and political orientations as education, although differences persist in some important dimensions. Overall, there is no strong evidence of any ""middle class particularism"" : values appear to gradually shift with income, and middle class values are between the ones of poorer and richer classes. If any, the only peculiarity of middle class values is moderation. The analysis also finds changes in values across countries to be of much larger magnitude than the ones dictated by income, education, and individual characteristics, suggesting that individual values vary primarily within bounds dictated by each society.","2017","2022-07-11 12:47:48","2022-07-11 12:47:48","","","28","","","","","Is There Such Thing as Middle Class Values?","","","","","SSRN","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: msL6zgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=msL6zgEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why have some developing country states been more successful at facilitating industrialization than others? An answer to this question is developed by focusing both on patterns of state construction and patterns of state intervention aimed at promoting industrialization. Four countries are analyzed in detail - South Korea, Brazil, India, and Nigeria - over the twentieth century. The states in these countries varied from cohesive-capitalist (mainly in Korea), through fragmented-multiclass (mainly in India), to neo-patrimonial (mainly in Nigeria). It is argued that cohesive-capitalist states have been most effective at promoting industrialization and neo-patrimonial states the least. The performance of fragmented-multiclass states falls somewhere in the middle. After explaining in detail as to why this should be so, the study traces the origins of these different state types historically, emphasizing the role of different types of colonialisms in the process of state construction in the developing world.","2004-08-30","2022-07-11 11:58:34","2022-07-11 11:58:44","","","484","","","","","State-Directed Development","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=w_r7wLD--VoC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Political Science / Political Process / General; Political Science / Colonialism & Post-Colonialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"RL55CN3H","book","2022","Koh, B. C.","Japan's Administrative Elite","","978-0-520-30643-1","","","","A major player in Japanese society is its government bureaucracy. Neither Japan's phenomenal track record in the world marketplace nor its remarkable success in managing its domestic affairs can be understood without insight into how its government bureaucracy works—how its elite administrators are recruited, socialized, and promoted; how they interact among themselves and with other principal players in Japan, notably politicians; how they are rewarded; and what happens to them when they retire at a relatively young age. Yet, despite its pivotal importance, there is no comprehensive and up-to-date study of Japan's administrative elite in the English language. This book seeks to fill that gap. Koh examines patterns of continuity and change, identifies similarities and differences between Japan and four other industrialized democracies (the United States, Britain, France, and Germany), and assesses the implications of the Japanese model of public management. Though many features of Japanese bureaucracy are found in the Western democracies, the degree to which they manifest themselves in Japan appears to be unsurpassed. Koh shows that the Japanese model of public management contains both strengths and weaknesses. For example, the price Japan pays for the high caliber of its administrative elite is the stifling rigidity of a multiple track system, a system with second-class citizens and demoralized ""non-career"" civil servants who actually bear a lion's share of administrative burden. The Japanese experience demonstrates not only how steep the price of success can be but also the enduring effects of culture over structure. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact.

"G2AGU26Q","book","2003","Knack, Stephen F.","Democracy, Governance, and Growth","","978-0-472-06823-4","","","","For many decades, underdevelopment in much of the world was blamed variously on capital deficits, exploitation by rich nations, and market-distorting economic policies. The chapters in this volume provide much of the evidence underpinning a growing consensus among development and growth economists that successful economic development depends more fundamentally on the way societies are organized and governed. They argue that ""good governance"" is a prerequisite to sustained increases in living standards. The difference between developmental success and failure in this view has little to do with natural resource availability, climate, aid, or developed nations' policies. Rather, it is largely a function of whether incentives within a given society steer wealth-maximizing individuals toward producing new wealth or toward diverting it from others. The chapters, seminal essays written by Mancur Olson and his IRIS Center colleagues, provide theoretical and/or empirical underpinnings for the emerging consensus that differences in the way governments and societies are organized have enormous implications for the structure of incentives faced by politicians, bureaucrats, investors, and workers, which in turn determines the level of a nation's material well-being. Overall this volume applies tools and concepts from the ""New Institutional Economics"" to some of the major issues in economic development. It will be of interest to scholars and students of various disciplines--including political science, law, and sociology as well as economics--interested in the determinants of economic development and global economic change. The book will also be of interest to many aid practitioners, particularly those working in anticorruption and public sector reform issues.

However, there are many countries where politicians win elections by giving money, jobs, and services in direct exchange for votes. This is not just true in the developing world, but also in economically developed countries - such as Japan and Austria - that clearly meet the definition of stable, modern democracies. This book offers explanations for why politicians engage in clientelistic behaviours and why voters respond. Using newly collected data on national and sub-national patterns of patronage and electoral competition, the contributors demonstrate why explanations based on economic modernization or electoral institutions cannot account for international variation in patron-client and programmatic competition. Instead, they show how the interaction of economic development, party competition, governance of the economy, and ethnic heterogeneity may work together to determine the choices of patrons, clients and policies.","2007-03-29","2022-07-11 11:51:21","2022-07-11 11:51:40","","","344","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Policies","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oKs6oahqfjoC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oKs6oahqfjoC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They point to the United States as the longest-lived and most stable liberal democracy in history. What they often fail to mention, though, is that it took considerable time to extend democracy throughout the country.The contributors to this volume suggest that it is intellectually fruitful to consider the U.S. case in comparison to other countries. They argue that the development of democracy is ongoing in America; that even with a written constitution grounded in liberal democracy, the meaning and significance of U.S. democracy are still evolving. This volume shows that democratization and the pursuit of democracy are processes affected by multiple and continuing challenges—including such issues as citizenship, race, institution building, and political movements—as patterns and practices of politics and governance continue to change.This innovative approach contributes significantly to comparative democratization studies, a field normally confined to Latin America and former communist countries. The U.S. case is a unique reference point for students of American political development and comparative democratization.","2009-08-05","2022-07-11 11:51:06","2022-07-11 11:51:06","","","346","","","","","Democratization in America","","","","","JHU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: _kXzDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=_kXzDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies); History / United States / General; Political Science / American Government / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Very few have considered corruption and clientelism as structural products of an interwoven connection between capital accumulation, bureaucratic rationalization, interest intermediation and political participation from below. This volume analyzes key aspects of the debate such as: should corruption and clientelism be evaluated as a 'lubricant' in terms of administrative efficiency - legitimate demands from the margins of society to redress social and economic inequality or to readdress economic development? What would be the effect of strengthening policing to control political corruption? Could electoral reform or a decentralization of government power be a cure for all?

The Forest Ranger has been essential reading for generations of professionals and scholars in forestry, public administration, and organizational behavior who are interested in the administration of public lands and how the top managers of a large, dispersed organization with multiple objectives like the Forest Service shape the behavior of its field officers into a coherent, unified program. Published as a special reprint in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Forest Service, The Forest Ranger is as relevant and timely today as when it was first issued in 1960. In addition to the original text, this special reprint of The Forest Ranger includes two new forewords and an afterword that highlight how much we have learned from Herbert Kaufman. The first foreword, by Harold K. (Pete) Steen, former president of the Forest History Society, considers the book's impact on the forestry community and explains its continued relevance in light of changes in the culture and mission of today's Forest Service. The second, by Richard P. Nathan, co-director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, considers the book's contribution to our understanding of administrative and organizational behavior. A new afterword by author Herbert Kaufman describes how his landmark study came into being and offers a candid assessment of how his theories about the agency's operations and its future have held up over time. In 1960, the Forest Service had a welldeserved reputation for excellence, and The Forest Ranger was a seminal analysis of the how's and why's of its success. Kaufman also warned, however, that an organization so unified and well adapted to its environment would have difficulties navigating social change. He was right in his concerns: The environmental, civil rights, and women's movements have all presented challenges to the character and purpose of the Forest Service, ultimately changing the organization in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Now, as then, The Forest Ranger is a striking and prescient case study of how a complex organization operates and evolves over time.","2010-09-30","2022-07-11 11:48:33","2022-07-11 11:48:33","","","271","","","","","The Forest Ranger","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: eIhYnZqsQEYC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eIhYnZqsQEYC","","Political Science / Public Affairs & Administration; Nature / Ecology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The end of the Cold War has not ushered in the global peace and prosperity that many had anticipated. Volatile new democracies in Eastern Europe, fierce tribalism in Africa, civil war and ethnic violence in the Near East, and widespread famine and disease—not to mention the brutal rift developing as wealthy nations reap the benefits of seemingly boundless technology while other parts of the world slide into chaos—are among the issues Kaplan identifies as the most important for charting the future of geopolitics. Historical antecedents in Gibbon's Decline and Fall and in the legacies of statesmen such as Henry Kissinger contribute to this bracingly prophetic framework for addressing the new global reality.

Americans more often rely on legal threats and lawsuits. American laws are generally more complicated and prescriptive, adjudication more costly, and penalties more severe. In a thoughtful and cogently argued book, Robert Kagan examines the origins and consequences of this system of adversarial legalism. Kagan describes the roots of adversarial legalism and the deep connections it has with American political institutions and values. He investigates its social costs as well as the extent to which lawyers perpetuate it. Ranging widely across many legal fields, including criminal law, environmental regulations, tort law, and social insurance programs, he provides comparisons with the legal and regulatory systems of western Europe, Canada, and Japan that point to possible alternatives to the American methods. Kagan notes that while adversarial legalism has many virtues, its costs and unpredictability often alienate citizens from the law and frustrate the quest for justice. This insightful study deepens our understanding of law and its relationship to politics in America and raises valuable questions about the future of the American legal system.","2009-06-30","2022-07-11 11:45:38","2022-07-11 11:45:38","","","353","","","","","Adversarial Legalism","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RnZUiYVAPxQC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=RnZUiYVAPxQC","","Law / Comparative; Law / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Daniel","Eurolegalism: The Transformation of Law and Regulation in the European Union","","978-0-674-06105-7","","","","Despite western Europe's traditional disdain for the United States' ""adversarial legalism,"" the European Union is shifting toward a very similar approach to the law, according to Daniel Kelemen. Coining the term ""eurolegalism"" to describe the hybrid that is now developing in Europe, he shows how the political and organizational realities of the EU make this shift inevitable. The model of regulatory law that had long predominated in western Europe was more informal and cooperative than its American counterpart. It relied less on lawyers, courts, and private enforcement, and more on opaque networks of bureaucrats and other interests that developed and implemented regulatory policies in concert. European regulators chose flexible, informal means of achieving their objectives, and counted on the courts to challenge their decisions only rarely. Regulation through litigation-central to the U.S. model-was largely absent in Europe. But that changed with the advent of the European Union. Kelemen argues that the EU's fragmented institutional structure and the priority it has put on market integration have generated political incentives and functional pressures that have moved EU policymakers to enact detailed, transparent, judicially enforceable rules-often framed as ""rights""-and back them with public enforcement litigation as well as enhanced opportunities for private litigation by individuals, interest groups, and firms.","2011-04-01","2022-07-11 11:45:09","2022-07-11 11:45:09","","","379","","","","","Eurolegalism","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TMZjktLoLQEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=TMZjktLoLQEC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Law / Comparative; Law / Judicial Power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"KELI77NK","book","1982","Johnson, Chalmers","MITI and the Japanese Miracle: The Growth of Industrial Policy, 1925-1975","","978-0-8047-6560-2","","","","The focus of this book is on the Japanese economic bureaucracy, particularly on the famous Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), as the leading state actor in the economy. Although MITI was not the only important agent affecting the economy, nor was the state as a whole always predominant, I do not want to be overly modest about the importance of this subject. The particular speed, form, and consequences of Japanese economic growth are not intelligible without reference to the contributions of MITI. Collaboration between the state and big business has long been acknowledged as the defining characteristic of the Japanese economic system, but for too long the state's role in this collaboration has been either condemned as overweening or dismissed as merely supportive, without anyone's ever analyzing the matter. The history of MITI is central to the economic and political history of modern Japan. Equally important, however, the methods and achievements of the Japanese economic bureaucracy are central to the continuing debate between advocates of the communist-type command economies and advocates of the Western-type mixed market economies. The fully bureaucratized command economies misallocate resources and stifle initiative; in order to function at all, they must lock up their populations behind iron curtains or other more or less impermeable barriers. The mixed market economies struggle to find ways to intrude politically determined priorities into their market systems without catching a bad case of the English disease or being frustrated by the American-type legal sprawl. The Japanese, of course, do not have all the answers. But given the fact that virtually all solutions to any of the critical problems of the late twentieth century--energy supply, environmental protection, technological innovation, and so forth--involve an expansion of official bureaucracy, the particular Japanese priorities and procedures are instructive. At the very least they should forewarn a foreign observer that the Japanese achievements were not won without a price being paid.","1982-06","2022-07-11 11:44:47","2022-07-11 11:44:47","","","409","","","","","MITI and the Japanese Miracle","","","","","Stanford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=bbGlwsjW-ekC","","POLITICAL SCIENCE / Public Affairs & Administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once every decade, it is ""decline time"" in America. In recent years, it has been the unstoppable rise of China that has spelled ""finis America."" What the Chinese juggernaut is today, the Soviet Union (""We shall bury you"") was in the 1950s. The Vietnam decade of the 1960s was described as America’s ""collective suicide attempt,"" while in the 1970s, the United States succumbed to Jimmy Carter’s famous ""malaise,"" as the dollar dangerously plummeted. The 1980s unquestionably belonged to a resurgent Japan, the ""Rising Sun,"" whereas in the 1990s, Europe shone forth as an ""empire by example."" In the naughts, it was ""Asia Rising"" that became the flavor of the decade. Despite a litany of prognostications, these contenders have all fallen back, one by one. While it may be catnip for the media to play up America as a has-been, Josef Joffe, a leading German commentator and Stanford University academic, compellingly shows that Declinism is not a cold-eyed diagnosis but a device in the style of the ancient prophets: ""Thou shalt perish, unless…"" Gloom is a prophecy that must be believed so that it will turn out wrong. Joffe repeatedly demonstrates how the ""economic miracles"" that propelled the rising tide of challengers flounder against their own limits. Hardly confined to Europe alone, Declinism has also been an especially nifty career builder for American politicians, among them Kennedy, Nixon, and Reagan, who all rode into the White House by hawking ""the end is near."" Buttressing his argument with facts, Joffe demonstrates that America’s future is sanguine. In contrast to the Carter years, the economic woes of the Obama era look more like a nasty migraine. By historical standards, the U.S. defense burden today is extraordinarily low, hence sustainable over the long haul. Immigration (plus a healthy birth rate) will not only keep the nation younger than China, Japan, Europe, and Russia but will continue to bring in the world’s best and brightest. Indeed, America is the ""world's Ph.D. factory"" both in science and engineering, while its R&D spending dwarfs the ""rising rest."" Its uniquely deep and wide capital market encourages innovations and continues to turn dreams into vibrant companies. Joffe argues that it is only if America ""freezes up"" by enshrining privilege, closing its doors, and withdrawing from the world that it will succumb to the rigor mortis that has overwhelmed previous empires. Effortlessly mixing keen historical insights with brilliant diplomatic and economic analysis, The Myth of America's Decline becomes a remarkable reflection on our nation’s standing in the world and an eye-opening account that challenges the pervasive and now tired notion that America is on the decline.","2014","2022-07-11 11:44:34","2022-07-11 11:44:34","","","352","","","","","The Myth of America's Decline","","","","","W.

How did America’s Founders envision the presidency? What should a constitutional democracy look like—and how can it be fixed when it appears to be broken? Something is definitely wrong with Donald Trump’s presidency, but what exactly? The extraordinary negative reaction to Trump’s election—by conservative intellectuals, liberals, Democrats, and global leaders alike—goes beyond ordinary partisan and policy disagreements. It reflects genuine fear about the vitality of our constitutional system. The Founders, reaching back to classical precedents, feared that their experiment in mass self-government could produce a demagogue: a charismatic ruler who would gain and hold on to power by manipulating the public rather than by advancing the public good. President Trump, who has played to the mob and attacked institutions from the judiciary to the press, appears to embody these ideas. How can we move past his rhetoric and maintain faith in our great nation? In The Demagogue’s Playbook, acclaimed legal scholar Eric A.

This is a controversial claim. It implies that some trajectories of socioeconomic change are more likely than others--and consequently that certain changes are foreseeable. Once a society has embarked on industrialization, for example, a whole syndrome of related changes, from mass mobilization to diminishing differences in gender roles, is likely to appear. These changes in worldviews seem to reflect changes in the economic and political environment, but they take place with a generational time lag and have considerable autonomy and momentum of their own. But industrialization is not the end of history. Advanced industrial society leads to a basic shift in values, de-emphasizing the instrumental rationality that characterized industrial society. Postmodern values then bring new societal changes, including democratic political institutions and the decline of state socialist regimes. To demonstrate the powerful links between belief systems and political and socioeconomic variables, this book draws on a unique database, the World Values Surveys. This database covers a broader range than ever before available for looking at the impact of mass publics on political and social life. It provides information from societies representing 70 percent of the world's population--from societies with per capita incomes as low as $300 per year to those with per capita incomes one hundred times greater and from long-established democracies with market economies to authoritarian states.","2020-06-30","2022-07-11 11:38:26","2022-07-11 11:38:26","","","463","","","","","Modernization and Postmodernization","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: D9PgDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=D9PgDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Demography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, building on interviews with Supreme Court justices, members of Congress, and judicial and legislative staffers, the book theorizes that congressional attacks are driven by public discontent with the Court. From this theoretical model, predictions are derived about the decision to engage in Court-curbing and judicial responsiveness to Court-curbing activity in Congress. The Limits of Judicial Independence draws on illustrative archival evidence, systematic analysis of an original dataset of Court-curbing proposals introduced in Congress from 1877 onward and judicial decisions.","2010-11-22","2022-07-11 11:37:57","2022-07-11 11:37:57","","","357","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=dJ--UwwHw9oC","","Political Science / General; Law / Constitutional; Law / General; Political Science / American Government / General; Law / Judicial Power","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"PJVL3QFA","book","2008","Hyman, Harold M.","American Singularity: The 1787 Northwest Ordinance, the 1862 Homestead and Morrill Acts, and the 1944 G. I. Bill","","978-0-8203-3296-3","","","","Since the first shots rang out at Lexington and Concord, signaling the beginning of open war between the colonies and England, America has been credited with a singular conviction, a concern for military veterans' and others' economic and political rights. The idea of America as a promised land of economic opportunity, social mobility, and political freedom has not always flourished. Historians have both given it reality and shaken its substance as they exposed an undercurrent of greed, class conflict, and corruption. In this book Harold Hyman explores the question of American singularity, using the Northwest Ordinance, the Homestead and Morrill acts, and the G.I Bill to measure individual access to land, education, and law. The Northwest Ordinance, enacted in 1787 to encourage settlement of the nation's untamed territories, mandated the establishment of public schools and stable property rights in newly settled lands--specific terms which enshrined the basic liberties secured by the Revolutionary War. Hyman shows that through the Homestead and Morrill acts of 1862, legislators sought to preserve the values of the Union and to prepare for the entrance of the black man into citizenship. Equal access to public lands in the West and to state land-grant universities, countered the economic and social injustices blacks and poor whites would face after the Civil War. Finally, Hyman asserts that the G.I. Bill preserved beneficial social programs forged during the depression, carrying into post-World War II America a widespread concern for education and housing opportunities. Examining the legislation that emerged from three periods of conflict in American history, Hyman reveals a consistent pattern favoring equal access to land, education, and law--a progression of singular, if sometimes flawed, attempts to embody in our statutes the values and aspirations that sparked our major wars.","2008-08-01","2022-07-11 11:37:13","2022-07-11 11:37:13","","","110","","","","","American Singularity","","","","","University of Georgia Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7gDc3z17pPoC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=7gDc3z17pPoC","","Political Science / Civil Rights; History / United States / General; Law / Civil Rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet conventional models of rent-seeking are unable to explain how it can drive decades of rapid growth in some countries, and at other times be associated with spectacular economic crises. This book argues that the rent-seeking framework has to be radically extended by incorporating insights developed by political scientists, institutional economists and political economists if it is to explain the anomalous role played by rent-seeking in Asian countries. It includes detailed analysis of Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Indian sub-continent, Indonesia and South Korea. This new critical and multidisciplinary approach has important policy implications for the debates over institutional reform in developing countries.

The Great Urban Transformation investigates what is happening in cities, the urban edges, and the rural fringe in order to explain these relations. In the inner city of major metropolitan centers, municipal governments battle high-ranking state agencies to secure land rents from redevelopment projects, while residents mobilize to assert property and residential rights. At the urban edge, as metropolitan governments seek to extend control over their rural hinterland through massive-scale development projects, villagers strategize to profit from the encroaching property market. At the rural fringe, township leaders become brokers of power and property between the state bureaucracy and villages, while large numbers of peasants are dispossessed, dispersed, and deterritorialized, and their mobilizational capacity is consequently undermined. The Great Urban Transformation explores these issues, and provides an integrated analysis of the city and the countryside, elite politics and grassroots activism, legal-economic and socio-political issues of property rights, and the role of the state and the market in the property market.","2010","2022-07-11 11:33:47","2022-07-11 11:33:47","","","273","","","","","The Great Urban Transformation","","","","","OUP Oxford","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 3GYVDAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=3GYVDAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Development / Business Development; Political Science / Public Policy / Regional Planning; Social Science / Demography; Business & Economics / Development / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"S8FHF4DI","book","2013","Hirschman, Albert O.","The Passions and the Interests: Political Arguments for Capitalism before Its Triumph","","978-1-4008-4851-5","","","","In this volume, Albert Hirschman reconstructs the intellectual climate of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to illuminate the intricate ideological transformation that occurred, wherein the pursuit of material interests--so long condemned as the deadly sin of avarice--was assigned the role of containing the unruly and destructive passions of man. Hirschman here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and Weberian thinking. Among the insights presented here is the ironical finding that capitalism was originally supposed to accomplish exactly what was soon denounced as its worst feature: the repression of the passions in favor of the ""harmless,"" if one-dimensional, interests of commercial life. To portray this lengthy ideological change as an endogenous process, Hirschman draws on the writings of a large number of thinkers, including Montesquieu, Sir James Steuart, and Adam Smith. Featuring a new afterword by Jeremy Adelman and a foreword by Amartya Sen, this Princeton Classics edition of The Passions and the Interests sheds light on the intricate ideological transformation from which capitalism emerged triumphant, and reaffirms Hirschman's stature as one of our most influential and provocative thinkers.Some images inside the book are unavailable due to digital copyright restrictions.","2013-10-06","2022-07-11 11:29:04","2022-07-11 11:29:04","","","189","","","","","The Passions and the Interests","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: nW0PAAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=nW0PAAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / General; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries; History / Modern / 17th Century; History / Modern / 18th Century; Business & Economics / Economic History","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Addressing economics, fascism, history, socialism and the Holocaust, Hayek unwraps the trappings of socialist ideology.

Pendergast's reign came to an end in 1939, after an investigation led by Special Agent Rudolph Hartmann of the U.S. Department of the Treasury resulted in Pendergast's conviction for income tax evasion. In 1942, Hartmann's report was submitted to Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, in whose papers it has remained for the past fifty-six years. While researching the relations between Pendergast & Franklin D. Roosevelt, Robert H. Ferrell came across Hartmann's landmark report-the only firsthand account of the investigation that brought down the greatest political machine of its time. Reading like a popular ""whodunit,"" The Kansas City Investigation traces Pendergast's life in political power from his roots as a young bookkeeper to his demise as one of America's most infamous crime bosses. Pendergast's influence was at its height in 1936 when his power reached not merely to every precinct & ward in Kansas City but also to the statehouse in Jefferson City & Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. It was during this time that Pendergast took a massive bribe-$460000-from 137 national fire insurance companies operating within Missouri, opening him to attack by his enemies. Early in 1938, President Roosevelt received a tip from Missouri Governor Lloyd C. Stark regarding Pendergast's illegal bribe. Although the president had at one time been a supporter of Pendergast, he now considered Stark a more important political ally. Roosevelt in turn asked the Treasury Department to investigate Pendergast. The intelligence unit of the Treasury Department put Hartmann, its best operative, on the case. Within a year Hartmann & his agents had found enough evidence to set the ball rolling toward Boss Tom's demise. More than a simple account of the collapse of the Pendergast machine, The Kansas City Investigation takes the reader on a mysterious ride through the twists & turns of this intriguing investigation, all from an insider's perspective. More important, Hartmann's report provides historians & readers alike the opportunity to evaluate the machine era in American political history-an era that, according to the investigation, ""proved the old axiom that 'Truth is stranger than fiction.'""","1999","2022-07-11 11:25:59","2022-07-11 11:25:59","","","203","","","","","The Kansas City Investigation","","","","","University of Missouri Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: v920HpkbuwIC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=v920HpkbuwIC","","History / United States / State & Local / Midwest (IA, IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, ND, NE, OH, SD, WI); Political Science / American Government / State","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We all know that the very rich have gotten a lot richer these past few decades while most Americans haven’t. In fact, the exorbitantly paid have continued to thrive during the current economic crisis, even as the rest of Americans have continued to fall behind. Why do the “haveit- alls” have so much more? And how have they managed to restructure the economy to reap the lion’s share of the gains and shift the costs of their new economic playground downward, tearing new holes in the safety net and saddling all of us with increased debt and risk? Lots of so-called experts claim to have solved this great mystery, but no one has really gotten to the bottom of it—until now. In their lively and provocative Winner-Take-All Politics, renowned political scientists Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson demonstrate convincingly that the usual suspects—foreign trade and financial globalization, technological changes in the workplace, increased education at the top—are largely innocent of the charges against them. Instead, they indict an unlikely suspect and take us on an entertaining tour of the mountain of evidence against the culprit. The guilty party is American politics. Runaway inequality and the present economic crisis reflect what government has done to aid the rich and what it has not done to safeguard the interests of the middle class. The winner-take-all economy is primarily a result of winner-take-all politics. In an innovative historical departure, Hacker and Pierson trace the rise of the winner-take-all economy back to the late 1970s when, under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress, a major transformation of American politics occurred. With big business and conservative ideologues organizing themselves to undo the regulations and progressive tax policies that had helped ensure a fair distribution of economic rewards, deregulation got under way, taxes were cut for the wealthiest, and business decisively defeated labor in Washington. And this transformation continued under Reagan and the Bushes as well as under Clinton, with both parties catering to the interests of those at the very top. Hacker and Pierson’s gripping narration of the epic battles waged during President Obama’s first two years in office reveals an unpleasant but catalyzing truth: winner-take-all politics, while under challenge, is still very much with us. Winner-Take-All Politics—part revelatory history, part political analysis, part intellectual journey— shows how a political system that traditionally has been responsive to the interests of the middle class has been hijacked by the superrich. In doing so, it not only changes how we think about American politics, but also points the way to rebuilding a democracy that serves the interests of the many rather than just those of the wealthy few.","2010","2022-07-11 11:22:06","2022-07-11 11:22:06","","","368","","","","","Winner-Take-All Politics","","","","","Simon and Schuster","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Pjofa9Z1ProC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Pjofa9Z1ProC","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Public Policy / General; Political Science / Political Economy; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By 1913, it was four times greater than Mexico's and seven times greater than Brazil's. This volume seeks to explain the nineteenth-century lag in Latin American economic development. The essays break with longstanding dependency traditions in Latin American historiography that focus on foreign influences to explain Latin American underdevelopment. Instead, they apply the approaches and methods of the New Economic History--which encompasses a wide arsenal of analytic tools and quantitative techniques informed by neo-classical economic theory--arguing that the causes for Latin America's laggard economic growth in the nineteenth century had far more to do with internal political and legal structures than putative external dependency. The volume is marked by geographical and topical diversity. Four essays deal with Mexico, two with Brazil, and two compare the two countries. Topically, two essays present overviews of nineteenth-century economic performance, two deal with the impact of independence, two deal with capital markets, and the remaining three address regional growth, the impact of railroads, and the economic effects of ""culture.""

It argues that greater involvement of local populations in decision-making processes may contribute to significant poverty reduction.","2003","2022-07-11 11:21:01","2022-07-11 11:21:01","","","176","","","","","Empowering the Poor","","","","","United Nations Capital Development Fund","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: dlWaAAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=dlWaAAAAIAAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"S2U2VES9","book","2020","McConville, Mike; Marsh, Luke","The Myth of Judicial Independence","","978-0-19-255527-4","","","","Through an examination of the history of the rules that regulate police interrogation (the Judges' Rules) in conjunction with plea bargaining and the Criminal Procedure Rules, this book explores the 'Westminster Model' under which three arms of the State (parliament, the executive, and the judiciary) operate independently of one another. It reveals how policy was framed in secret meetings with the executive which then actively misled parliament in contradiction to its ostensible formal relationship with the legislature. This analysis of Home Office archives shows how the worldwide significance of the Judges' Rules was secured not simply by the standing of the English judiciary and the political power of the empire but more significantly by the false representation that the Rules were the handiwork of judges rather than civil servants and politicians. The book critically examines the claim repeatedly advanced by judges that ""judicial independence"" is justified by principles arising from the ""rule of law"" and instead shows that the ""rule of law"" depends upon basic principles of the common law, including an adversarial process and trial by jury, and that the underpinnings of judicial action in criminal justice today may be ideological rather than based on principles.","2020-06-28","2022-07-11 11:19:08","2022-07-11 11:19:08","","","337","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RyrtDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=RyrtDwAAQBAJ","","Law / Legal History; Law / Criminal Law / General; Law / Criminal Law / Sentencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
