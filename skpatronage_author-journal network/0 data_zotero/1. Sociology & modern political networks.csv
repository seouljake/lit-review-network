We study applicants to the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer project from two sites: the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Using network analysis, we develop a model of recruitment that predicts participation on the basis of the structural positions of individuals within the multiorganizational fields, as well as on the basis of individual background factors. We also study the role that the recruitment context plays, by comparing the results at these two universities. Independent of the individual background factors, structural position in the multiorganizational field predicts participation in Freedom Summer at Wisconsin, but not at Berkeley. The effects of individual background factors on participation are also contingent on the recruitment context. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results for the study of the effects of multiorganizational fields and recruitment contexts on participation in social movements.","1988-06-01","2022-05-23 09:06:31","2022-05-23 09:06:31","2022-05-23 09:06:31","357-382","","3","3","","Sociol Forum","Social networks and social movements","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Network Analysis; Social Issue; Social Movement; Social Network; Theoretical Implication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"ND979VKA","book","1938","Ferguson, Russell J.","Early Western Pennsylvania Politics","","978-0-8229-7527-4","","","","The conflict between the Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian concepts of democracy was nowhere more vigorous or bitter than in Western Pennsylvania during the period when the region evolved from an agrarian to an industrial economy. This book traces the political aspects of this transformation step by step. The region's long allegiance to Jeffersonianism, was in part due to a group of plodding but shrewd politicians who remained in power until well after the War of 1812, before they were succeded by Hamiltonians. Ferguson profiles the major politicians and political events in the region from Revolutionary War times until the 1820s.","1938-03-15","2022-05-23 09:06:04","2022-05-23 09:06:04","","","328","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=T-8K89LcOlEC","","History / General; History / United States / State & Local / Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Class-collaborative rebellions correlate highly with a mode of production that makes for cooperative interests and interclass dependence, while class-conflict rebellions correlate highly with a mode of production that makes for antagonistic interests and interclass independence. But class-collaboration was unlikely without a target, which the state provided. Yet the state became the target in subsistence regions where the lack of markets made the raising of tax revenues particularly difficult and where subsistence classes were not dependent on the state for markets and, therefore, had little incentive to cooperate with the state. On the other hand, in regions with a commercial mode of production, raising tax revenues was less burdensome and classes tended to be dependent on the state for markets and, therefore, less likely to engage in antistate collective action.","1985-07-01","2022-05-23 09:01:20","2022-05-23 09:01:20","2022-05-23 09:01:20","445-468","","4","14","","Theor Soc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Collective Action; Crucial Issue; Mutual Dependence; Regional Mode; Similar Mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Karen Barkey shows how Turkish strategies of incorporating peasants and rotating elites kept both groups dependent on the state, unable and unwilling to rebel. Bandits, formerly mercenary soldiers, were not interested in rebellion but concentrated on trying to gain state resources, more as rogue clients than as primitive rebels. The state's ability to control and manipulate bandits—through deals, bargains and patronage—suggests imperial strength rather than weakness, she maintains.","2018-10-18","2022-05-23 08:52:42","2022-05-23 08:52:42","2022-05-23 08:52:42","","","","","","","Bandits and Bureaucrats","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.7591/9781501720871 Publication Title: Bandits and Bureaucrats","","/Users/eesaack/Zotero/storage/5USDTCS8/Barkey - 2018 - Bandits and Bureaucrats The Ottoman Route to Stat.pdf","","","History; Middle East Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"X36432PE","book","2018","Arthur, W. Brian","The Economy As An Evolving Complex System II","","978-0-429-97626-1","","","","A new view of the economy as an evolving, complex system has been pioneered at the Santa Fe Institute over the last ten years, This volume is a collection of articles that shape and define this view?a view of the economy as emerging from the interactions of individual agents whose behavior constantly evolves, whose strategies and actions are always adapting.The traditional framework in economics portrays activity within an equilibrium steady state. The interacting agents in the economy are typically homogenous, solve well-defined problems using perfect rationality, and act within given legal and social structures. The complexity approach, by contrast, sees economic activity as continually changing?continually in process. The interacting agents are typically heterogeneous, they must cognitively interpret the problems they face, and together they create the structures?markets, legal and social institutions, price patters, expectations?to which they individually react. Such structures may never settle down. Agents may forever adapt and explore and evolve their behaviors within structures that continually emerge and change and disappear?structures these behaviors co-create. This complexity approach does not replace the equilibrium one?it complements it.The papers here collected originated at a recent conference at the Santa Fe Institute, which was called to follow up the well-known 1987 SFI conference organized by Philip Anderson, Kenneth Arrow, and David Pines. They survey the new study of complexity and the economy. They apply this approach to real economic problems and they show the extent to which the initial vision of the 1987 conference has come to fruition.","2018-05-04","2022-05-23 08:49:30","2022-05-23 08:49:30","","","428","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5EpnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=5EpnDwAAQBAJ","","Mathematics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Picking up from where its companion volume, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, left off, Lineages traces the development of Absolutist states in the early modern period from their roots in European feudalism, and assesses their various trajectories. Why didn’t Italy develop into an Absolutist state in the same, indigenous way as the other dominant Western countries, namely Spain, France and England? On the other hand, how did Eastern European countries develop into Absolutist states similar to those of the West, when their social conditions diverged so drastically? Reflecting on examples in Islamic and East Asian history, as well as the Ottoman Empire, Anderson concludes by elucidating the particular role of European development within universal history.","2013-04-29","2022-05-23 08:48:45","2022-05-23 08:48:45","","","582","","","","","","","","","","Verso Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: V2vnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=V2vnDwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / General; Political Science / Constitutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this first volume, Michael Mann examines inter-relations between these elements from neolithic times, through ancient Near Eastern civilizations, the classical Mediterranean age, and medieval Europe, up to just before the Industrial Revolution in England. It offers explanations of the emergence of the state and social stratification; of city-states, militaristic empires, and the persistent interaction between them; of the world salvation religions; and of the particular dynamism of medieval and early modern Europe. It ends by generalizing about the nature of overall social development, the varying forms of social cohesion, and the role of classes and class struggle in history.

"LXWN3B77","book","1979","Skocpol, Theda","States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China","","978-0-521-29499-7","","","","State structures, international forces, and class relations: Theda Skocpol shows how all three combine to explain the origins and accomplishments of social-revolutionary transformations. From France in the 1790s to Vietnam in the 1970s, social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the outcomes of such revolutions. And it develops in depth a rigorous, comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, the author urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to explanations of revolutions.","1979-02-28","2022-05-23 09:34:19","2022-07-01 04:37:26","","","436","","","","","States and Social Revolutions","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: so0gddc0w3UC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=so0gddc0w3UC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Revolutionary; Political Science / Political Freedom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ""Whiskey Rebellion"" marked the first large-scale resistance to a law of the U.S. government under the Constitution. This classic confrontation between champions of liberty and defenders of order was long considered the most significant event in the first quarter-century of the new nation. Thomas P. Slaughter recaptures the historical drama and significance of this violent episode in which frontier West and cosmopolitan East battled over the meaning of the American Revolution. The book not only offers the broadest and most comprehensive account of the Whiskey Rebellion ever written, taking into account the political, social and intellectual contexts of the time, but also challenges conventional understandings of the Revolutionary era.","1986-09-04","2022-05-23 09:34:34","2022-05-23 09:34:34","","","300","","","","","The Whiskey Rebellion","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=G1S-pGtzCOcC","","History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies); History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 09:43:34","2022-07-01 04:48:13","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why do we always miss turning points as they transpire? When does what doesn't happen mean as much, if not more, than what does? Andrew Abbott considers these fascinating questions in Time Matters, a diverse series of essays that constitutes the most extensive analysis of temporality in social science today. Ranging from abstract theoretical reflection to pointed methodological critique, Abbott demonstrates the inevitably theoretical character of any methodology.  Time Matters focuses particularly on questions of time, events, and causality. Abbott grounds each essay in straightforward examinations of actual social scientific analyses. Throughout, he demonstrates the crucial assumptions we make about causes and events, about actors and interaction and about time and meaning every time we employ methods of social analysis, whether in academic disciplines, market research, public opinion polling, or even evaluation research. Turning current assumptions on their heads, Abbott not only outlines the theoretical orthodoxies of empirical social science, he sketches new alternatives, laying down foundations for a new body of social theory.","2001-07-15","2022-05-23 09:43:11","2022-05-23 09:43:11","","","329","","","","","Time Matters","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: lVmkHsEo3CsC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=lVmkHsEo3CsC","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Social Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What they rarely learn, however, is how to actually theorize. The Art of Social Theory is a practical guide to doing just that. In this one-of-a-kind user's manual for social theorists, Richard Swedberg explains how theorizing occurs in what he calls the context of discovery, a process in which the researcher gathers preliminary data and thinks creatively about it using tools such as metaphor, analogy, and typology. He guides readers through each step of the theorist’s art, from observation and naming to concept formation and explanation. To theorize well, you also need a sound knowledge of existing social theory. Swedberg introduces readers to the most important theories and concepts, and discusses how to go about mastering them. If you can think, you can also learn to theorize. This book shows you how.

Offering major insights into the building blocks of social life, it identifies which locally emergent structures have the capacity to grow into larger ones and shows how structural tendencies associated with smaller structures shape and constrain patterns of larger structures. The book then investigates the role such structures have played in the emergence of the modern nation-state. Bringing together the latest findings in sociology, anthropology, political science, and history, John Levi Martin traces how sets of interpersonal relationships become ordered in different ways to form structures. He looks at a range of social structures, from smaller ones like families and street gangs to larger ones such as communes and, ultimately, nation-states. He finds that the relationships best suited to forming larger structures are those that thrive in conditions of inequality; that are incomplete and as sparse as possible, and thereby avoid the problem of completion in which interacting members are required to establish too many relationships; and that abhor transitivity rather than assuming it. Social Structures argues that these ""patronage"" relationships, which often serve as means of loose coordination in the absence of strong states, are nevertheless the scaffolding of the social structures most distinctive to the modern state, namely the command army and the political party.","2009-07-27","2022-05-23 09:52:24","2022-05-23 09:52:24","2022-05-23 09:52:24","","","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400830534 Publication Title: Social Structures","","/Users/eesaack/Zotero/storage/KD9ZQG6X/Martin - 2009 - Social Structures.pdf","","","Aggression; Agonism; American Sociological Review; Analogy; Asymmetry; Balance theory; Benefice; Binary relation; Bystander effect; Centrality; Chimpanzee; Claude Lévi-Strauss; Command hierarchy; Commoner; Competition; Consideration; Cousin marriage; Credibility; De facto; Determination; Dominance hierarchy; Egalitarianism; Emergence; Employment; Eviatar Zerubavel; Exchange of women; Explanation; Feudalism; Formal organization; Governance; Harrison White; Heuristic; Household; Ideology; Incentive; Informant; Institution; Interpersonal relationship; Intransitivity; Kinship; Matrilineality; Mercenary; Nation state; Nobility; Obligation; Oligarchy; Organization; Ownership; Participant; Party system; Patrilineality; Patronage; Political machine; Political party; Political structure; Politician; Politics; Popularity; Power structure; Preferential attachment; Probability; Quantity; Requirement; Result; Retinue; Ruler; Scaffolding; Shortage; Sibling; Small-world experiment; Social Action; Social actions; Social distance; Social order; Social organization; Social relation; Social research; Social science; Social space; Social status; Social structure; Social theory; Society; Sociology; Spoils system; Spouse; State (polity); State formation; State socialism; Structural analysis; Subset; Tax; Terminology; The Other Hand; Theory; Trade-off; Tree structure; Vassal; Warfare; Wealth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.","2002","2022-05-23 09:52:08","2022-05-23 09:52:08","2022-05-23 09:52:08","143-166","","1","28","","","From Factors to Actors","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141117","","","","","cellular automata; complexity; emergence; genetic algorithm; self-organization; simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are many countries where politicians win elections by giving money, jobs, and services in direct exchange for votes. This is not just true in the developing world, but also in economically developed countries - such as Japan and Austria - that clearly meet the definition of stable, modern democracies. This book offers explanations for why politicians engage in clientelistic behaviours and why voters respond. Using newly collected data on national and sub-national patterns of patronage and electoral competition, the contributors demonstrate why explanations based on economic modernization or electoral institutions cannot account for international variation in patron-client and programmatic competition. Instead, they show how the interaction of economic development, party competition, governance of the economy, and ethnic heterogeneity may work together to determine the choices of patrons, clients and policies.","2007-03-29","2022-05-23 09:49:28","2022-07-01 04:19:30","","","344","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Policies","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oKs6oahqfjoC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=oKs6oahqfjoC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms — particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications. Comparative Politics is a series for students, teachers, and researchers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour.

"UIMT5XFV","book","1998","Hutchcroft, Paul David","Booty Capitalism: The Politics of Banking in the Philippines","","978-0-8014-3428-0","","","","In the early postwar years, the Philippines seemed poised for long-term economic success; within the region, only Japan had a higher standard of living. By the early 1990s, however, the country was dismissed as a perennial aspirant to the ranks of newly industrializing economies, unable to convert its substantial developmental assets into developmental success. Major reforms of the mid-1990s bring new hope, explains Paul D. Hutchcroft, but accompanying economic gains remain relatively modest and short-lived. What has gone wrong? The Philippines should have all the ingredients for developmental success: tremendous entrepreneurial talents; a well-educated and anglophone workforce; a rich endowment of natural resources; a vibrant community of economists and development specialists; and abundant overseas assistance. Hutchcroft attributes the laggard economic performance to long-standing deficiencies in the Philippine political sphere. The country's experience, he asserts, illuminates the relationship between political and economic development in the modern Third World. Through careful examination of interactions between the state and the major families of the oligarchy in the banking sector since 1960, Hutchcroft shows the political obstacles to Philippine development. ""Booty capitalism,"" he explains, emerged from relations between a patrimonial state and a predatory oligarchy. Hutchcroft concludes by examining the capacity of recent reform efforts to encourage transformation toward a political, economic order more responsive to the developmental needs of the Philippine nation as a whole.","1998","2022-05-23 10:07:13","2022-05-23 10:07:13","","","308","","","","","Booty Capitalism","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IqlmT6BsFoQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=IqlmT6BsFoQC","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Business & Economics / Banks & Banking; History / Asia / Southeast Asia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"SVNJAYKV","book","1984","Eisenstadt, Shmuel Noah; Roniger, Luis","Patrons, Clients and Friends: Interpersonal Relations and the Structure of Trust in Society","","978-0-521-28890-3","","","","The form of social relations described by the terms 'patronage' and 'patron-client relations' is of central concern to sociologists, anthropologists and political scientists today. Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 10:04:07","2022-07-04 03:15:39","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In December 2008 the National Democratic Congress (NDC) regained political power, and within months rifts appeared over the allocation of ministerial portfolios. The intra-party murmurings became public when two factions supported rival candidacies for the party's presidential nomination. The pro-Rawlings faction supported the candidacy of Nana Konadu Agyemang-Rawlings, and the anti-Rawlings bloc backed President John Evans Atta Mills. Drawing on Boucek's (2009) typology of factionalism, this article argues that factionalism within the NDC is a dynamic and complex process of informal groupings competing and jockeying for power to satisfy members' interests. It draws three conclusions: party factions are ad hoc groupings that are nurtured into a power bloc, and are constellated around particular individuals; factional conflicts are not rooted in ideology, but are based on differences in policy goals, interests and patronage; and, finally, factionalism fluctuates between cooperative and competitive phases.","2012-12","2022-05-23 10:26:30","2022-05-23 10:26:30","2022-05-23 10:26:30","573-601","","4","50","","","Party factions and power blocs in Ghana","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these analyses largely overlook the process of candidate recruitment and selection, an issue intricately tied to political outcomes and the functioning of democracy. In this volume, a team of experts uses a common analytic framework developed by the editors to analyze the recruitment and selection of executive and legislative candidates in six major countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. It does so from two perspectives. First, as a dependent variable, the volume explores the party and legal factors that drive the recruitment and selection process, thus producing particular types of candidates. It then considers candidate type as an independent variable, analyzing the impact of candidate type on campaigns, political parties, and the behavior of legislators and presidents once elected. The result is the first fully comparative inquiry into a central, but largely neglected, determinant of politics in Latin America.","2012-03-31","2022-05-23 10:29:33","2022-05-23 10:29:33","","","462","","","","","Pathways to Power","","","","","Penn State Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6di7zeTbjIQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=6di7zeTbjIQC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find confirmation for the idea that party positions are linked to factional preferences. Overall, the party works as a ‘bounded oligarchy’. Furthermore, the electoral payoff of party unity increases the impact of factional constraints when general elections approach.

Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 10:35:06","2022-07-04 03:15:53","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where do new alternatives, new organizational forms, and new types of people come from? Combining biochemical insights about the origin of life with innovative and historically oriented social network analyses, John Padgett and Walter Powell develop a theory about the emergence of organizational, market, and biographical novelty from the coevolution of multiple social networks. They demonstrate that novelty arises from spillovers across intertwined networks in different domains. In the short run actors make relations, but in the long run relations make actors. This theory of novelty emerging from intersecting production and biographical flows is developed through formal deductive modeling and through a wide range of original historical case studies. Padgett and Powell build on the biochemical concept of autocatalysis--the chemical definition of life--and then extend this autocatalytic reasoning to social processes of production and communication. Padgett and Powell, along with other colleagues, analyze a very wide range of cases of emergence. They look at the emergence of organizational novelty in early capitalism and state formation; they examine the transformation of communism; and they analyze with detailed network data contemporary science-based capitalism: the biotechnology industry, regional high-tech clusters, and the open source community.","2012-10-14","2022-05-23 10:41:55","2022-07-04 03:23:15","2022-05-23 10:41:55","","","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400845552 Publication Title: The Emergence of Organizations and Markets","","/Users/eesaack/Zotero/storage/PNXY9P7X/Padgett 그리고 Powell - 2012 - The Emergence of Organizations and Markets.pdf","","","China; democracy; social networks; political parties; Russia; social science; agent-based model; altruism; altruistic reproduction; autocatalysis; autocatalytic reasoning; autocracy; autopoiesis; biochemistry; biochemistry literature; biographical autocatalysis; biographical novelty; biotechnology companies; biotechnology industry; Boris Yeltsin; business alliances; business groups; Calvinism; capitalism; cellular autocatalysis; cellular companies; cellular phone industry; chemistry; commercial capitalism; communism; communist economic reform; conflict displacement; corporate merchant-banks; depoliticized market; dual inclusion; Eastern Europe; economic development; economic experimentation; economic production; economic reform; economic reform campaigns; economic reforms; empirical chemistry; financial markets; Florence; Florentine international finance; Florentine partnership systems; foreign investment; formal models; genealogical communication; German nationalism; Germany; high-tech clusters; homology; human organizations; Hungarian economy; hypercycle model; hypercycles; interenterprise networks; international trade; interorganizational network formation; joint-stock company; lateral control; linguistic autocatalysis; market formation; market reform policies; metabolism-first hypothesis; migration; mobile telecom market; molecular biology; multiple social networks; multiple-network ensemble; Netherlands; noble kinship; open source community; organizational genesis; organizational innovations; organizational novelty; origin of life; patronage; political settlement; privatization; production autocatalysis; Prussia; public peer pressure; refunctionality; Renaissance; RNA-first hypothesis; social sequence analysis; Soviet Union; state finance; state formation; state ownership; state planning system; state socialism collapse; stigmergy; structural vulnerability; symbolic communication; tipping; transposition; Tuscan merchant-banks; Tuscany; university science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"2CFV629T","webpage","2014","Simral, Vit","The cost of partitocracy: party funding in East Central Europe","","","","","https://e-theses.imtlucca.it/154/","The work’s goal is to contribute to the discussion on cartelisation in the party systems of East Central Europe. Its contribution to the research field is to be found in a thorough analysis of the budgets of political parties in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, to a smaller degree also of the budgets of political parties in Austria, Germany and Slovenia. In total thirty arguments found in the existing scholarly literature are discussed, with a focus on their relation to budgets and election strategies of political parties. These arguments are analysed with the help of basic tools of quantivative statistical analysis and the qualitative method of comparison of selected features of the analysed cases. The work’s analytical part is based on two new original datasets. The first one, where data on budgets of political parties are collected, uses publicly available sources found in both the off-line as well as the on-line world of today. The second one uses original data collected by the means of an electronic questionnaire send to representatives of political parties in the six researched countries. The work defines two new concepts that serve as the theoretical basis of the analysis: the rule drive and the strategy drive. The rule drive is the part of a party’s budget that is predominantly formed by legal regulations on political parties, their funding and activities. On the income side, the rule drive is mostly visible in the share of party budget comprised by state subsidies. On the expenditure side, the rule drive is most apparent in the legal limits of expenses parties may allocate to election campaigning. In addition, the rule drive encompasses also the various limits on donations permittable to be accepted by political parties, limits on parties‘ business activities, or the legal fees that parties are obliged to pay to enter certain types of elections. The strategy drive is the causal agent that is predominantly formed by parties‘ free decisions on how they wish to conduct their day-to-day activities and their election campaigning. On the income side, the strategy drive is represented by the amount of membership fees collected, donations accepted or loans taken out. On the expenditure side, the strategy drive is the formula by which political parties allocate their financial assets to the various activities each political party carries out: office operations, administrative work for their elected representatives and officials, education of party members and promotion towards the public in general, election campaigning. Both concepts are of interest for the analysis and all their segments are used to assess the various structural features of party budgets. Original data collected for the work show that parties in their lifetime go through an evolution of their budgets, from one relying mostly on private donations and spending the majority of assets on elections to one relying on membership fees, state subsidies in the case of an electoral sucess, and spending a larger part of assets on activities not related to election campaigning. The specific shape of budget evolution depends largely on the size of their budget – parties with smaller budgets feature also a different budget structure than parties with budgets larger. This rule applies across the spectrum, from the largest parties in the dataset to the smallest one. The quantitative data on budget sizes are in the work translated into meaningful, categories based on budget sizes. , The categories are labeled weight classes, mimicking the weight classes found in the boxing world, from bantamweight parties, with annual budgets up to €10 thousand, to super heavyweight parties, with annual budgets over €10 million. All parties in the researched countries are thus be classified. Based on these categories, is it shown that the largest, super heavy parties in East Central Europe receive the bulk of all public funding. The model of subsidies distribution differs in the researched countries and the numbers show that it is difficult to assess whether one system is more cartelised than the other on the basis of distributed state subsidies. Easier and less arguable is to assess the relative transparency of the models of party regulations and regulations of party funding in each of the researched country. Austria, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia and Poland are in the recent time undergoing a turn towards more transparency, with new laws already in place or currently being adopted. The Czech Republic is noticeably lagging behind. The last phenomenon discussed in the work is that certain features of budgets, including its size and structure, correlate with certain party strategies. Parties of certain budget size and structure have different campaigning strategies, different policies and different opinions than parties of different budget size and structure. The collected data shows links between several variables, such as parties with large subsidies share in their budgets see as legitimate larger subsidies share than parties without subsidies, or heavyweight and middleweight parties spend a significantly larger share of their election expenses on the Internet than super heavyweight parties. Finally is discussed the behaviour of a specific set of parties that are in the researched dataset mostly found in the heavyweight and middleweight class. These parties have different campaign strategies, keep their election campaign spending higher than the rest and their budgets do not go through the same evolutionary shift as do the budgets of other parties. They do not increase their fee-paying membership and do not sustain significant day-to-day activities not directly related to election campaigning. These parties are since 2007 at the latest most successful in challenging the ‘cartel’ established by larger parties in national parliaments. The set of these parties overlaps in a large part with the set of ‘populist’ parties as discussed in other, ideology and party programme-oriented literature. Or, if restated, the populist parties are in their majority distinguished not only by their programmatic profile, but also by the structure of their budgets and related party strategy features. Ultimately, the work provides a lot of empirical evidence for the discussion of the concept of ‘cartel’ in the region of East Central Europe. It supports with hard data some of the old folk theorems and creates a firm data and conceptual basis for further research of party funding in East Central Europe.","2014-12","2022-05-23 10:46:26","2022-05-23 10:46:26","2022-05-23 10:46:26","","","","","","","The cost of partitocracy","","","","","","","en","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","","","","","Num Pages: 153 Publisher: IMT Alti Studi Lucca","","/Users/eesaack/Zotero/storage/4CGHHKEW/Simral - 2014 - The cost of partitocracy party funding in East Ce.pdf; /Users/eesaack/Zotero/storage/SSBJHHM9/154.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It draws on fieldwork that included 71 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with party representatives and ordinary members (23 in Zambia, 24 in Burundi, and 24 in Togo). The interviews were conducted mostly in provincial urban centres over a period of four months in 2011 and 2012. The study conceives political parties as strategically acting organizations embedded in unique socio-political contexts; it argues that two hitherto neglected terms are especially useful for understanding and comparing them: cohesion and party-voter linkage. The argument is grounded on three key features of sub-Saharan party politics: a hostile operating environment, the prevalence of face-to-face political communication, and the supposed absence of ideology (which is re-interpreted as the presence of a single dominant ideology - development). The study conceptualizes cohesion as a prerequisite of Panebianco's (1988) institutionalization. A new, expanded classification of party – voter linkage types is formulated and a distinction is made between linkage proper and the genre in which it is enacted. Cohesion and linkage are combined in a comparative framework that enables generation of specific hypotheses about parties’ behaviour.","2014-01-22","2022-05-23 10:46:39","2022-05-23 10:46:39","2022-05-23 10:46:39","","","","","","","Political Parties in Zambia, Burundi and Togo","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2483987","","/Users/eesaack/Zotero/storage/4BARRIGV/Tobolka - 2014 - Political Parties in Zambia, Burundi and Togo Org.pdf","","","Burundi; cohesion; linkage; organization; Political parties; Togo; Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2483987","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This dissertation demonstrates that factionalism is key. When intra-party factions are united, subnational dominant parties retain power even under adverse electoral conditions. By contrast, divisions and conflicts among internal groups lead these parties to lose even in favorable electoral contexts. I test these claims using a variety of quantitative and qualitative evidence from Mexico, focusing on the electoral performance of the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) in contemporary gubernatorial elections. Democratization potentially undermines unity in dominant parties because it provides politicians with viable exit options (i.e., joining the opposition) and because authoritarian central party committees no longer control subnational politics. Yet, I argue that factions can cooperate under democracy when they were more autonomous from the center during the authoritarian period. The negotiation skills acquired in the past help them ""get along"" in the absence of an external enforcer. By contrast, previously subordinated factions never acquired such skills and quickly became antagonistic to each other under democracy. As I show, collaboration had positive electoral consequences in subnational elections whereas antagonism had pernicious ones","2013","2022-07-16 14:25:41","2022-07-16 14:25:41","","","582","","","","","Why Factions Matter","","","","","University of Texas at Austin","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: gKeUoAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=gKeUoAEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He is as much a topic of debate in Zimbabwe and beyond as the late president Robert Gabriel Mugabe. Tsvangirai's legacy, like Mugabe's, remains indisputably controversial and conflicted. Broadly, the divided opinion on the Tsvangirai legacy can be represented, firstly, by those who argue that Tsvangirai was the champion of democracy and the face of the struggle for human rights in Zimbabwe. In this light, Tsvangirai has been variously described as a ""selfless...people's hero"", a ""colossus of the struggle for democracy"", ""the commander of the struggle"", ""a symbol of courage and resistance"", and ""the doyen of constitutionalism"" in Zimbabwe. On the other hand, critics have described Tsvangirai as a ""sell-out"", ""a Judas Iscariot"", ""traitor"", and ""coward"", among other nefarious and pejorative characterisations. Drawing on all these opinions and the various characterisations of Tsvangirai, this book provides a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary appraisal of a gigantic trade unionist and political figure who, in his life and in death, inspires different narratives, emotions and values. This book is therefore about a mortal but ""living"" figure who left an indelible mark on Zimbabwe, Africa and the rest of the world in fields such as trade unionism, governance and politics. As such, the book is handy for students and practitioners in African studies, political science, policy studies, economics, history, global studies and development studies.","2022-03-11","2022-07-16 14:26:24","2022-07-16 14:26:24","","","364","","","","","Morgan Richard Tsvangirai's Legacy","","","","","African Books Collective","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: KUdpEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=KUdpEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / World / African","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"G7MFV5DZ","book","2008","Colla, Elliott","Conflicted Antiquities: Egyptology, Egyptomania, Egyptian Modernity","","978-0-8223-9039-8","","","","Conflicted Antiquities is a rich cultural history of European and Egyptian interest in ancient Egypt and its material culture, from the early nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth. Consulting the relevant Arabic archives, Elliott Colla demonstrates that the emergence of Egyptology—the study of ancient Egypt and its material legacy—was as consequential for modern Egyptians as it was for Europeans. The values and practices introduced by the new science of archaeology played a key role in the formation of a new colonial regime in Egypt. This fact was not lost on Egyptian nationalists, who challenged colonial archaeologists with the claim that they were the direct heirs of the Pharaohs, and therefore the rightful owners and administrators of ancient Egypt’s historical sites and artifacts. As this dispute developed, nationalists invented the political and expressive culture of “Pharaonism”—Egypt’s response to Europe’s Egyptomania. In the process, a significant body of modern, Pharaonist poetry, sculpture, architecture, and film was created by artists and authors who looked to the ancient past for inspiration.Colla draws on medieval and modern Arabic poetry, novels, and travel accounts; British and French travel writing; the history of archaeology; and the history of European and Egyptian museums and exhibits. The struggle over the ownership of Pharaonic Egypt did not simply pit Egyptian nationalists against European colonial administrators. Egyptian elites found arguments about the appreciation and preservation of ancient objects useful for exerting new forms of control over rural populations and for mobilizing new political parties. Finally, just as the political and expressive culture of Pharaonism proved critical to the formation of new concepts of nationalist identity, it also fueled Islamist opposition to the Egyptian state.","2008-01-11","2022-07-16 14:27:27","2022-07-16 14:27:27","","","364","","","","","Conflicted Antiquities","","","","","Duke University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: mLkEUbyHYWEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=mLkEUbyHYWEC","","Social Science / Archaeology; History / Ancient / Egypt","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book evaluates well-established theories and trends in exiting party politics literature and relates them to the case of Turkey. It explores fundamental questions such as: Who controls party organizations and how does the locus of control change over time? What kinds of power struggles are observed inside a party and between whom? What do the present and past records of party membership imply for party organizations? What role do grassroots activists play in local and national politics? How do the ideological orientations of party members differ from party leaders and other voters? What types of social cleavages shape political parties and how do they change over time? What constitutes the relationship between the state and parties today? Who finances political parties and what does this imply about the quality of democracy? How and why do party systems change?  The various chapters show that party politics in the Turkish context is significantly different to Western and new democracies. By highlighting the significant contribution the Turkish case can make to existing conceptual frameworks and theories, this book will be a valuable resource for anyone studying political parties, party systems and comparative politics, as well as Turkish politics.","2018-01-29","2022-07-16 14:29:20","2022-07-16 14:29:20","","","269","","","","","Party Politics in Turkey","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: qClKDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=qClKDwAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Regional Studies; Political Science / World / Middle Eastern","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With a booming economy, a formidable military, and a rapidly expanding population, China is emerging as a twenty-first-century global superpower. China&#39;s prosperity has increased dramatically in the last two decades, propelling the nation to a prominent position in the international community. Yet China&#39;s ancient history still informs and shapes its understanding of itself in relation to the world. As a highly developed and modern nation, China is something of a paradox.Though China is an international leader in modern business and technology, its past remains a source of guiding principles for the nation&#39;s foreign policy. In The Mind of Empire: China&#39;s History and Modern Foreign Relations, Christopher A. Ford demonstrates how China&#39;s historical awareness shapes its objectives and how the resulting national consciousness continues to influence the country&#39;s policymaking. Despite its increasing prominence among modern, developed nations, China continues to seek guidance from a past characterized by Confucian notions of hierarchical political order and a &quot;moral geography&quot; that places China at the center of the civilized world. The Mind of Empire describes how these attitudes have clashed with traditional Western ideals of sovereignty and international law. Ford speculates about how China&#39;s legacy may continue to shape its foreign relations and offers a warning about the potential global consequences. He examines major themes in China&#39;s conception of domestic and global political order, describes key historical precedents, and outlines the remarkable continuity of China&#39;s Sinocentric stance. Expertly synthesizing historical, philosophical, religious, and cultural analysis into a cohesive study of the Chinese worldview, Ford offers revealing insights into modern China.The Mind of Empire tracks China&#39;s astonishing development within the framework of a national ideology that is intrinsically linked to the distant past. Ford&#39;s perspective is both pertinent and prescient at a time when China is expanding into new areas of power, both economically and militarily. As China&#39;s power and influence continue to grow, its reliance on ancient philosophies and political systems will shape its approach to foreign policy in idiosyncratic and, perhaps, highly problematic ways.","2004-09-10","2022-07-16 14:29:40","2022-07-16 14:29:40","","","266","","","","","Southern Political Party Activists","","","","","University Press of Kentucky","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: OYZu7S7azSIC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=OYZu7S7azSIC","","Political Science / International Relations / General; History / Asia / China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through these moments—during which social movements have embraced advances in communications technologies—he illuminates the complicated, dangerous, innovative, and exciting relationship between these technologies, social movements, and social change. Brescia shows that, almost without fail, developments in how we communicate shape social movements, just as those movements change the very technologies themselves.From the printing press to the television, social movements have leveraged communications technologies to advance change. In this moment of rapidly evolving communications, it's imperative to assess the role that the Internet, mobile devices, and social media can play in promoting social justice. But first we must look to the past, to examples of movements throughout American history that successfully harnessed communications technology, thus facilitating positive social change. Such movements embraced new communications technologies to help organize their communities; to form grassroots networks in order to facilitate face-to-face interactions; and to promote positive, inclusive messaging that stressed their participants' shared dignity and humanity. Using the past as prologue, The Future of Change provides effective lessons in the use of communications technology so that we can have the best communicative tools at our disposal—both now and in the future.","2020-04-15","2022-07-16 14:33:54","2022-07-16 14:33:54","","","241","","","","","The Future of Change","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: emW1DwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=emW1DwAAQBAJ","","Technology & Engineering / General; Social Science / Media Studies; Law / Computer & Internet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this major work, the sociologists Eve Chiapello and Luc Boltanski suggest that we should be addressing the crisis of anticapitalist critique by exploring its very roots. Via an unprecedented analysis of management texts which influenced the thinking of employers and contributed to reorganization of companies over the last decades, the authors trace the contours of a new spirit of capitalism. From the middle of the 1970s onwards, capitalism abandoned the hierarchical Fordist work structure and developed a new network-based form of organization which was founded on employee initiative and relative work autonomy, but at the cost of material and psychological security. This new spirit of capitalism triumphed thanks to a remarkable recuperation of the “artistic critique”—that which, after May 1968, attacked the alienation of everyday life by capitalism and bureaucracy. At the same time, the “social critique” was disarmed by the appearance of neocapitalism and remained fixated on the old schemas of hierarchical production. This book, remarkable for its scope and ambition, seeks to lay the basis for a revival of these two complementary critiques.","2018-01-01","2022-07-16 14:36:24","2022-07-16 14:36:24","","","653","","","","","","","","","","Verso Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Tm_nDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Tm_nDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; Political Science / Political Economy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This transformation undermined kinship, the traditional mechanism of power for local elites, and replaced it with a national system of patronage-clientage that enabled English elites to transcend local politics.  In this radical revision, Bearman shows how the breakdown of the elite kinship system occurred with the widening circles of intermarriage and the growth of the gentry class. Diversification in religion and occupation further estranged elites. For many this meant seeking patronage-clientage ties with the Crown and appropriating for themselves a new source of power and prestige under these national relations. In examining the slow change from kinship to patronage-clientage, Bearman details increasing conflict among local gentry who were uncertain as to what were the legitimate bases for social and political action. An outcome of this uncertainty was the lay elite's articulation of radical and abstract ideologies, puritanism, and constitutionalism, that aided the organization of their activities along national rather than local lines.  Bearman proposes a new method for historical sociology, one based on the analysis of social network structures. By focusing on the social networks in which the gentry of Norfolk, England, were embedded during the sixteenth century, Bearman shows that network-based models of identity are more powerful predictors of action than competing categorical, or interest-based, models. He depicts the emergence of modern social relations and links the appearance of radical religious identity to larger historical processes.","1993","2022-07-16 14:38:28","2022-07-16 14:38:28","","","216","","","","","Relations Into Rhetorics","","","","","Rutgers University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: rHV1QgAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=rHV1QgAACAAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet by the dawn of the twenty-first century, most democracies had directly elected presidents. David J. Samuels and Matthew S.

Catherine Scott here critically engages with the concept of state failure and provides an historical reinterpretation. She shows that, although the concept emerged in the context of the post-Cold War new world order, the phenomenon has been attendant throughout (and even before) the development of the Westphalian state system. Contemporary failed states, however, differ from their historical counterparts in one fundamental respect: they fail within their existing borders and continue to be recognised as something that they are not. This peculiarity derives from international norms instituted in the era of decolonisation, which resulted in the inviolability of state borders and the supposed universality of statehood. Scott argues that contemporary failed states are, in fact, failed post-colonies. Thus understood, state failure is less the failure of existing states and more the failed rooting and institutionalisation of imported and reified models of Western statehood.Drawing on insights from the histories of Uganda and Burundi, from pre-colonial polity formation to the present day, she explores why and how there have been failures to create effective and legitimate national states within the bounds of inherited colonial jurisdictions on much of the African continent.","2017-06-30","2022-07-16 14:40:27","2022-07-16 14:40:27","","","324","","","","","State Failure in Sub-Saharan Africa","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: YhOMDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=YhOMDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Asia / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Korea has experienced this problem much earlier. The history created weak parties that use deeply effective but harmful stories. This combination creates a downwards spiral where the performance of moral superiority becomes the sharpest weapon.

"D5Z6TSEY","book","2010","Boston, Jonathan; Bradstock, Andrew; Eng, David L.","Public Policy: Why Ethics Matters","","978-1-921666-75-9","","","","Ethics is a vigorously contested field. There are many competing moral frameworks, and different views about how normative considerations should inform the art and craft of governmental policy making. What is not in dispute, however, is that ethics matters. The ethical framework adopted by policy analysts and decision makers not only shapes how policy problems are defined, framed and analysed, but also influences which ethical principles and values are taken into account and their weighting. As a result, ethics can have a profound impact, both on the character of the policy process and the choices made by decision makers. PUBLIC POLICY: WHY ETHICS MATTERS brings together original contributions from leading scholars and practitioners with expertise in various academic disciplines, including economics, philosophy, physics, political science, public policy and theology. The volume addresses three main issues: fist, the ethical considerations that should inform the conduct of public officials and the task of policy analysis; second, the ethics of climate change; and third, ethics and economic policy. While the contributors have varying views on these important issues, they share a common conviction that the ethical dimensions of public policy need to be better understood and given proper attention in the policy-making process.","2010-10-01","2022-07-16 14:42:11","2022-07-16 14:42:11","","","327","","","","","Public Policy","","","","","ANU E Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: m3JDDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=m3JDDgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Affairs & Administration; Philosophy / Ethics & Moral Philosophy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on social science theories, the author analyses from a comparative perspective the ways institutional engineering concerning different dimensions of political accountability influenced the quality of democracy in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.

At the same time, intense rivalries pitted European states against one another in recurrent wars. Henning Hillmann examines the merchant community of Saint-Malo, Brittany, a key port in the French Atlantic economy, to shed light on the local networks that linked commerce and conflict in early modern Europe.Hillmann traces the development of Saint-Malo and the social structure of its merchant elite from the 1680s through the onset of the French Revolution. He pinpoints the role of privateering, showing how it enabled local merchant communities to secure their hold on established trades, seize new opportunities, and withstand the threats of armed conflict. In wartime, rulers commissioned ship-owning traders to fit out vessels as corsairs to raid enemy shipping. Within a mercantilist worldview, this state-sanctioned private war at sea aligned the interests of local elites and the royal government. Locally, within Saint-Malo, the partnerships that merchant elites formed in their privateering ventures gave rise to a cohesive network that held their community together amid outside conflicts. Combining rich descriptions of privateering campaigns with quantitative network analysis of partnership ties over more than a century, The Corsairs of Saint-Malo offers a new understanding of the local organizational foundations of early modern capitalist development.","2021-02-23","2022-07-16 14:44:38","2022-07-16 14:44:38","","","580","","","","","The Corsairs of Saint-Malo","","","","","Columbia University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: lNvfDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=lNvfDwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / France; Social Science / Sociology / General; History / Modern / 18th Century; Business & Economics / Economic History; History / Maritime History & Piracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyzing almost 500 intra-party documents from Italy, Germany and France, it presents a theory of intra-party politics that illuminates internal decision-making processes and sheds light on the outcomes of factional conflicts on the allocation of payoffs within the party, on the risk of a party split and on the survival of the party leader. Using text analysis, the results show that consensual dynamics can allow to preserve party unity and that directly elected leaders can exploit their larger autonomy either to reward followers or to prevent splits.

The authors adopt a sociological approach in understanding how power structures emerged in the wake of the Soviet collapse. The independencies in Central Asia did not happen as a consequence of a nationalist struggle, but because the USSR imploded. Thus, instead of the elites being replaced, the same Soviet elites who had competed for power in the previous system continued to do so in the new one, which they had to build, adapting themselves and the system to their needs. Additionally, unlike in the immense majority of the independent states that emerged from decolonization, the social movements and capacity to mobilize the people were very weak in the new Central Asian states. For this reason, the configuration of the new systems was the product of a competition for power between a very small number of elites who did not have to answer to the people and their demands. Thus, the new power regimes acquired a strong neopatrimonial component. Analyzing the structure of societies, economies and polities of post-socialist states, this book will be of great interest to scholars of Central Asia, to sociologists, and to scholars of China's rise.","2021-01-12","2022-07-16 15:00:58","2022-07-16 15:00:58","","","340","","","","","Political Regimes and Neopatrimonialism in Central Asia","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4bcTEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4bcTEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; History / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; History / Russia & the Former Soviet Union; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Political Ideologies / General; Business & Economics / Labor / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

She then analyzes its internal conflicts over policy and power and explains the party's changing stance on such issues as Taiwan's independence, international relations and economic policy.

While power transfer from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) back to the pro-status quo Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, KMT) in 2008 ushered a great leap of cross-Strait relations in the following years, the DPP’s coming back to power in 2016 has reversed the trend and brought back a cold peace between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait featuring the period of the Chen Shui-bian administration. Social cleavage and partisan confrontation on the island have justified Beijing’s strategy of selective engagement with the two main parties within Taiwan. The state of cross-Strait relations, therefore, has become a by-product of volatile party politics on the island.

In this period, the movement was transformed from a dislocated collection of groups and individuals into the largest organized body of anarchists in world history: the anarcho-syndicalist National Confederation of Labour (Confederación Nacional del Trabajo: CNT). At the same time, anarchist cultural practices became ingrained in localities across the whole of Spain, laying foundations which maintained the movement’s popular support until the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939.  The book shows that grassroots print culture was central to these developments: driving the development of ideology and strategy – broadly defined as terrorism, education and workplace organization – and providing an informal structure to a movement which shunned recognized leadership and bureaucracy.  This study offers a rich analysis of the cultural foundations of Spanish anarchism. This emphasis also challenges claims that the movement was ""exceptional"" or ""peculiar"" in its formation, by situating it alongside other decentralized, bottom-up mobilizations across historical and contemporary contexts, from the radical pamphleteering culture of the English Civil War to the use of social media in the Arab Spring.","2019-10-02","2022-07-16 15:06:52","2022-07-16 15:06:52","","","295","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 12SzDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=12SzDwAAQBAJ","","History / Social History; History / General; History / Europe / Spain & Portugal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analyzing almost 500 intra-party documents from Italy, Germany and France, it presents a theory of intra-party politics that illuminates internal decision-making processes and sheds light on the outcomes of factional conflicts on the allocation of payoffs within the party, on the risk of a party split and on the survival of the party leader. Using text analysis, the results show that consensual dynamics can allow to preserve party unity and that directly elected leaders can exploit their larger autonomy either to reward followers or to prevent splits.  This text will be of key interest to scholars and students of Party Politics, Political Institutions, European Politics and more broadly to Comparative Politics, Political Theory and Text Analysis.","2019-04-17","2022-07-16 15:13:44","2022-07-16 15:13:44","","","260","","","","","","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Ps-SDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In doing so, it provides a timely overview of key ABM methodologies and the most innovative approaches through a variety of empirical applications. It features cutting-edge research from leading academics and practitioners, and will provide a guide for characterising and parameterising human agents in empirical ABM. In order to facilitate learning, this text shares the valuable experiences of other modellers in particular modelling situations. Very little has been published in the area of empirical ABM, and this contributed volume will appeal to graduate-level students and researchers studying simulation modeling in economics, sociology, ecology, and trans-disciplinary studies, such as topics related to sustainability. In a similar vein to the instruction found in a cookbook, this text provides the empirical modeller with a set of 'recipes' ready to be implemented.Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful, simulation-modeling technique that has seen a dramatic increase in real-world applications in recent years. In ABM, a system is modeled as a collection of autonomous decision-making entities called “agents.” Each agent individually assesses its situation and makes decisions on the basis of a set of rules. Agents may execute various behaviors appropriate for the system they represent—for example, producing, consuming, or selling. ABM is increasingly used for simulating real-world systems, such as natural resource use, transportation, public health, and conflict. Decision makers increasingly demand support that covers a multitude of indicators that can be effectively addressed using ABM. This is especially the case in situations where human behavior is identified as a critical element. As a result, ABM will only continue its rapid growth.This is the first volume in a series of books that aims to contribute to a cultural change in the community of empirical agent-based modelling. This series will bring together representational experiences and solutions in empirical agent-based modelling. Creating a platform to exchange such experiences allows comparison of solutions and facilitates learning in the empirical agent-based modelling community. Ultimately, the community requires such exchange and learning to test approaches and, thereby, to develop a robust set of techniques within the domain of empirical agent-based modelling. Based on robust and defendable methods, agent-based modelling will become a critical tool for research agencies, decision making and decision supporting agencies, and funding agencies. This series will contribute to more robust and defendable empirical agent-based modelling.","2013-09-12","2022-07-16 15:14:44","2022-07-16 15:14:44","","","254","","","","","Empirical Agent-Based Modelling - Challenges and Solutions","","","","","Springer Science & Business Media","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: LajBAAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=LajBAAAAQBAJ","","Computers / Computer Simulation; Mathematics / Probability & Statistics / General; Mathematics / Probability & Statistics / Stochastic Processes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The committee was organized in late 1995 to respond to a growing need for prevention, management, and resolution of violent conflict in the international arena, a concern about the changing nature and context of such conflict in the post-Cold War era, and a recent expansion of knowledge in the field. The committee's main goal is to advance the practice of conflict resolution by using the methods and critical attitude of science to examine the effectiveness of various techniques and concepts that have been advanced for preventing, managing, and resolving international conflicts. The committee's research agenda has been designed to supplement the work of other groups, particularly the Carnegie Corporation of New York's Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict, which issued its final report in December 1997. The committee has identified a number of specific techniques and concepts of current interest to policy practitioners and has asked leading specialists on each one to carefully review and analyze available knowledge and to summarize what is known about the conditions under which each is or is not effective. These papers present the results of their work.","1999-05-20","2022-07-16 15:16:13","2022-07-16 15:16:13","","","73","","","","","","","","","","National Academies Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Oiuf7g0rAHgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Oiuf7g0rAHgC","","Political Science / Security (National & International); History / Military / Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include: micro-studies in rural India; sectoral studies in the areas of joint forest management, environment and education; and macro-studies of human development indicators that have a dimension of social capital.  Overall, the book demonstrates that civil society in India is mediated by unequal relationships of hierarchy, power and domination, and moreover, it is a society undergoing rapid changes. It therefore highlights the limitations of deploying a theoretical construct in such circumstances.","2004-11-08","2022-07-16 15:17:56","2022-07-16 15:17:56","","","336","","","","","Interrogating Social Capital","","","","","SAGE Publications India","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: AMqGAwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=AMqGAwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Social Science / Sociology / General; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
