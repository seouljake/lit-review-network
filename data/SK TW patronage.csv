Focusing on the collective identities framing conflict during these two upheavals and in the intervening period, Gould reveals that while class played a pivotal role in 1848, it was neighborhood solidarity that was the decisive organizing force in 1871.  The difference was due to Baron Haussmann's massive urban renovation projects between 1852 and 1868, which dispersed workers from Paris's center to newly annexed districts on the outskirts of the city. In these areas, residence rather than occupation structured social relations. Drawing on evidence from trail documents, marriage records, reports of police spies, and the popular press, Gould demonstrates that this fundamental rearrangement in the patterns of social life made possible a neighborhood insurgent movement; whereas the insurgents of 1848 fought and died in defense of their status as workers, those in 1871 did so as members of a besieged urban community.  A valuable resource for historians and scholars of social movements, this work shows that collective identities vary with political circumstances but are nevertheless constrained by social networks. Gould extends this argument to make sense of other protest movements and to offer predictions about the dimensions of future social conflict.","1995-12","2022-05-23 09:08:29","2022-05-23 09:08:29","","","272","","","","","Insurgent Identities","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Fbrf8i0NIu4C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=Fbrf8i0NIu4C","","History / Asia / Japan; History / Europe / France; Social Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We study applicants to the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer project from two sites: the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Using network analysis, we develop a model of recruitment that predicts participation on the basis of the structural positions of individuals within the multiorganizational fields, as well as on the basis of individual background factors. We also study the role that the recruitment context plays, by comparing the results at these two universities. Independent of the individual background factors, structural position in the multiorganizational field predicts participation in Freedom Summer at Wisconsin, but not at Berkeley. The effects of individual background factors on participation are also contingent on the recruitment context. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results for the study of the effects of multiorganizational fields and recruitment contexts on participation in social movements.","1988-06-01","2022-05-23 09:06:31","2022-05-23 09:06:31","2022-05-23 09:06:31","357-382","","3","3","","Sociol Forum","Social networks and social movements","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Network Analysis; Social Issue; Social Movement; Social Network; Theoretical Implication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book traces the political aspects of this transformation step by step. The region's long allegiance to Jeffersonianism, was in part due to a group of plodding but shrewd politicians who remained in power until well after the War of 1812, before they were succeded by Hamiltonians. Ferguson profiles the major politicians and political events in the region from Revolutionary War times until the 1820s.","1938-03-15","2022-05-23 09:06:04","2022-05-23 09:06:04","","","328","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=T-8K89LcOlEC","","History / General; History / United States / State & Local / Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Class-collaborative rebellions correlate highly with a mode of production that makes for cooperative interests and interclass dependence, while class-conflict rebellions correlate highly with a mode of production that makes for antagonistic interests and interclass independence. But class-collaboration was unlikely without a target, which the state provided. Yet the state became the target in subsistence regions where the lack of markets made the raising of tax revenues particularly difficult and where subsistence classes were not dependent on the state for markets and, therefore, had little incentive to cooperate with the state. On the other hand, in regions with a commercial mode of production, raising tax revenues was less burdensome and classes tended to be dependent on the state for markets and, therefore, less likely to engage in antistate collective action.","1985-07-01","2022-05-23 09:01:20","2022-05-23 09:01:20","2022-05-23 09:01:20","445-468","","4","14","","Theor Soc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","","Collective Action; Crucial Issue; Mutual Dependence; Regional Mode; Similar Mode","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Karen Barkey shows how Turkish strategies of incorporating peasants and rotating elites kept both groups dependent on the state, unable and unwilling to rebel. Bandits, formerly mercenary soldiers, were not interested in rebellion but concentrated on trying to gain state resources, more as rogue clients than as primitive rebels. The state's ability to control and manipulate bandits—through deals, bargains and patronage—suggests imperial strength rather than weakness, she maintains.","2018-10-18","2022-05-23 08:52:42","2022-05-23 08:52:42","2022-05-23 08:52:42","","","","","","","Bandits and Bureaucrats","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.7591/9781501720871 Publication Title: Bandits and Bureaucrats","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\5USDTCS8\Barkey - 2018 - Bandits and Bureaucrats The Ottoman Route to Stat.pdf","","","History; Middle East Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Brian","The Economy As An Evolving Complex System II","","978-0-429-97626-1","","","","A new view of the economy as an evolving, complex system has been pioneered at the Santa Fe Institute over the last ten years, This volume is a collection of articles that shape and define this view?a view of the economy as emerging from the interactions of individual agents whose behavior constantly evolves, whose strategies and actions are always adapting.The traditional framework in economics portrays activity within an equilibrium steady state. The interacting agents in the economy are typically homogenous, solve well-defined problems using perfect rationality, and act within given legal and social structures. The complexity approach, by contrast, sees economic activity as continually changing?continually in process. The interacting agents are typically heterogeneous, they must cognitively interpret the problems they face, and together they create the structures?markets, legal and social institutions, price patters, expectations?to which they individually react. Such structures may never settle down. Agents may forever adapt and explore and evolve their behaviors within structures that continually emerge and change and disappear?structures these behaviors co-create. This complexity approach does not replace the equilibrium one?it complements it.The papers here collected originated at a recent conference at the Santa Fe Institute, which was called to follow up the well-known 1987 SFI conference organized by Philip Anderson, Kenneth Arrow, and David Pines. They survey the new study of complexity and the economy. They apply this approach to real economic problems and they show the extent to which the initial vision of the 1987 conference has come to fruition.","2018-05-04","2022-05-23 08:49:30","2022-05-23 08:49:30","","","428","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 5EpnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=5EpnDwAAQBAJ","","Mathematics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Picking up from where its companion volume, Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, left off, Lineages traces the development of Absolutist states in the early modern period from their roots in European feudalism, and assesses their various trajectories. Why didn’t Italy develop into an Absolutist state in the same, indigenous way as the other dominant Western countries, namely Spain, France and England? On the other hand, how did Eastern European countries develop into Absolutist states similar to those of the West, when their social conditions diverged so drastically? Reflecting on examples in Islamic and East Asian history, as well as the Ottoman Empire, Anderson concludes by elucidating the particular role of European development within universal history.","2013-04-29","2022-05-23 08:48:45","2022-05-23 08:48:45","","","582","","","","","","","","","","Verso Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: V2vnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=V2vnDwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / General; Political Science / Constitutions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the focus on economic bases of elite opposition has obscured a second issue: co-optation benefits some elites at the expense of those who occupy disadvantaged positions in local patronage networks, inclining the latter to resist. This mechanism accounts for patterns of elite participation in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, a mass mobilization against state building in the postrevolutionary United States. Elites without patronage ties, and those whose clienteles overlapped with those of federal officers, were more likely to mobilize against the state.","1996-09","2022-05-23 08:47:52","2022-05-23 08:47:54","2022-05-23 08:47:51","400-429","","2","102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)","","Publisher: The University of Chicago Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LSNZKVQ5","book","1995","Gould, Roger V.","Insurgent Identities: Class, Community, and Protest in Paris from 1848 to the Commune","","978-0-226-30560-8","","","","In this important contribution both to the study of social protest and to French social history, Roger Gould breaks with previous accounts that portray the Paris Commune of 1871 as a continuation of the class struggles of the 1848 Revolution. Focusing on the collective identities framing conflict during these two upheavals and in the intervening period, Gould reveals that while class played a pivotal role in 1848, it was neighborhood solidarity that was the decisive organizing force in 1871.  The difference was due to Baron Haussmann's massive urban renovation projects between 1852 and 1868, which dispersed workers from Paris's center to newly annexed districts on the outskirts of the city. In these areas, residence rather than occupation structured social relations. Drawing on evidence from trail documents, marriage records, reports of police spies, and the popular press, Gould demonstrates that this fundamental rearrangement in the patterns of social life made possible a neighborhood insurgent movement; whereas the insurgents of 1848 fought and died in defense of their status as workers, those in 1871 did so as members of a besieged urban community.  A valuable resource for historians and scholars of social movements, this work shows that collective identities vary with political circumstances but are nevertheless constrained by social networks. Gould extends this argument to make sense of other protest movements and to offer predictions about the dimensions of future social conflict.","1995-12","2022-05-23 09:26:59","2022-05-23 09:26:59","","","272","","","","","Insurgent Identities","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Fbrf8i0NIu4C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=Fbrf8i0NIu4C","","History / Asia / Japan; History / Europe / France; Social Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book traces the political aspects of this transformation step by step. The region's long allegiance to Jeffersonianism, was in part due to a group of plodding but shrewd politicians who remained in power until well after the War of 1812, before they were succeded by Hamiltonians. Ferguson profiles the major politicians and political events in the region from Revolutionary War times until the 1820s.","1938-03-15","2022-05-23 09:25:37","2022-05-23 09:25:37","","","328","","","","","","","","","","University of Pittsburgh Pre","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=T-8K89LcOlEC","","History / General; History / United States / State & Local / Middle Atlantic (DC, DE, MD, NJ, NY, PA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this first volume, Michael Mann examines inter-relations between these elements from neolithic times, through ancient Near Eastern civilizations, the classical Mediterranean age, and medieval Europe, up to just before the Industrial Revolution in England. It offers explanations of the emergence of the state and social stratification; of city-states, militaristic empires, and the persistent interaction between them; of the world salvation religions; and of the particular dynamism of medieval and early modern Europe. It ends by generalizing about the nature of overall social development, the varying forms of social cohesion, and the role of classes and class struggle in history.

The ""Whiskey Rebellion"" marked the first large-scale resistance to a law of the U.S. government under the Constitution. This classic confrontation between champions of liberty and defenders of order was long considered the most significant event in the first quarter-century of the new nation. Thomas P. Slaughter recaptures the historical drama and significance of this violent episode in which frontier West and cosmopolitan East battled over the meaning of the American Revolution. The book not only offers the broadest and most comprehensive account of the Whiskey Rebellion ever written, taking into account the political, social and intellectual contexts of the time, but also challenges conventional understandings of the Revolutionary era.","1986-09-04","2022-05-23 09:34:34","2022-05-23 09:34:34","","","300","","","","","The Whiskey Rebellion","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=G1S-pGtzCOcC","","History / Americas (North, Central, South, West Indies); History / United States / Revolutionary Period (1775-1800)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From France in the 1790s to Vietnam in the 1970s, social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the outcomes of such revolutions. And it develops in depth a rigorous, comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, the author urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to explanations of revolutions.","1979-02-28","2022-05-23 09:34:19","2022-05-23 09:34:19","","","436","","","","","States and Social Revolutions","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: so0gddc0w3UC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=so0gddc0w3UC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Revolutionary; Political Science / Political Freedom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 09:43:34","2022-05-23 09:43:34","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Why do we always miss turning points as they transpire? When does what doesn't happen mean as much, if not more, than what does? Andrew Abbott considers these fascinating questions in Time Matters, a diverse series of essays that constitutes the most extensive analysis of temporality in social science today. Ranging from abstract theoretical reflection to pointed methodological critique, Abbott demonstrates the inevitably theoretical character of any methodology.  Time Matters focuses particularly on questions of time, events, and causality. Abbott grounds each essay in straightforward examinations of actual social scientific analyses. Throughout, he demonstrates the crucial assumptions we make about causes and events, about actors and interaction and about time and meaning every time we employ methods of social analysis, whether in academic disciplines, market research, public opinion polling, or even evaluation research. Turning current assumptions on their heads, Abbott not only outlines the theoretical orthodoxies of empirical social science, he sketches new alternatives, laying down foundations for a new body of social theory.","2001-07-15","2022-05-23 09:43:11","2022-05-23 09:43:11","","","329","","","","","Time Matters","","","","","University of Chicago Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: lVmkHsEo3CsC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=lVmkHsEo3CsC","","Social Science / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Social Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are many countries where politicians win elections by giving money, jobs, and services in direct exchange for votes. This is not just true in the developing world, but also in economically developed countries - such as Japan and Austria - that clearly meet the definition of stable, modern democracies. This book offers explanations for why politicians engage in clientelistic behaviours and why voters respond. Using newly collected data on national and sub-national patterns of patronage and electoral competition, the contributors demonstrate why explanations based on economic modernization or electoral institutions cannot account for international variation in patron-client and programmatic competition. Instead, they show how the interaction of economic development, party competition, governance of the economy, and ethnic heterogeneity may work together to determine the choices of patrons, clients and policies.","2007-03-29","2022-05-23 09:49:28","2022-05-23 09:49:28","","","344","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Policies","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oKs6oahqfjoC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=oKs6oahqfjoC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.","2002","2022-05-23 09:52:08","2022-05-23 09:52:08","2022-05-23 09:52:08","143-166","","1","28","","","From Factors to Actors","","","","","","","","","","","","Annual Reviews","","_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.soc.28.110601.141117","","","","","cellular automata; complexity; emergence; genetic algorithm; self-organization; simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Offering major insights into the building blocks of social life, it identifies which locally emergent structures have the capacity to grow into larger ones and shows how structural tendencies associated with smaller structures shape and constrain patterns of larger structures. The book then investigates the role such structures have played in the emergence of the modern nation-state. Bringing together the latest findings in sociology, anthropology, political science, and history, John Levi Martin traces how sets of interpersonal relationships become ordered in different ways to form structures. He looks at a range of social structures, from smaller ones like families and street gangs to larger ones such as communes and, ultimately, nation-states. He finds that the relationships best suited to forming larger structures are those that thrive in conditions of inequality; that are incomplete and as sparse as possible, and thereby avoid the problem of completion in which interacting members are required to establish too many relationships; and that abhor transitivity rather than assuming it. Social Structures argues that these ""patronage"" relationships, which often serve as means of loose coordination in the absence of strong states, are nevertheless the scaffolding of the social structures most distinctive to the modern state, namely the command army and the political party.","2009-07-27","2022-05-23 09:52:24","2022-05-23 09:52:24","2022-05-23 09:52:24","","","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400830534 Publication Title: Social Structures","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\KD9ZQG6X\Martin - 2009 - Social Structures.pdf","","","Wealth; Aggression; Agonism; American Sociological Review; Analogy; Asymmetry; Balance theory; Benefice; Binary relation; Bystander effect; Centrality; Chimpanzee; Claude Lévi-Strauss; Command hierarchy; Commoner; Competition; Consideration; Cousin marriage; Credibility; De facto; Determination; Dominance hierarchy; Egalitarianism; Emergence; Employment; Eviatar Zerubavel; Exchange of women; Explanation; Feudalism; Formal organization; Governance; Harrison White; Heuristic; Household; Ideology; Incentive; Informant; Institution; Interpersonal relationship; Intransitivity; Kinship; Matrilineality; Mercenary; Nation state; Nobility; Obligation; Oligarchy; Organization; Ownership; Participant; Party system; Patrilineality; Patronage; Political machine; Political party; Political structure; Politician; Politics; Popularity; Power structure; Preferential attachment; Probability; Quantity; Requirement; Result; Retinue; Ruler; Scaffolding; Shortage; Sibling; Small-world experiment; Social Action; Social actions; Social distance; Social order; Social organization; Social relation; Social research; Social science; Social space; Social status; Social structure; Social theory; Society; Sociology; Spoils system; Spouse; State (polity); State formation; State socialism; Structural analysis; Subset; Tax; Terminology; The Other Hand; Theory; Trade-off; Tree structure; Vassal; Warfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

What they rarely learn, however, is how to actually theorize. The Art of Social Theory is a practical guide to doing just that. In this one-of-a-kind user's manual for social theorists, Richard Swedberg explains how theorizing occurs in what he calls the context of discovery, a process in which the researcher gathers preliminary data and thinks creatively about it using tools such as metaphor, analogy, and typology. He guides readers through each step of the theorist’s art, from observation and naming to concept formation and explanation. To theorize well, you also need a sound knowledge of existing social theory. Swedberg introduces readers to the most important theories and concepts, and discusses how to go about mastering them. If you can think, you can also learn to theorize. This book shows you how. Concise and accessible, The Art of Social Theory features helpful examples throughout, and also provides practical exercises that enable readers to learn through doing.","2014-08-10","2022-05-23 09:56:07","2022-05-23 09:56:07","2022-05-23 09:56:07","","","","","","","","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400850358 Publication Title: The Art of Social Theory","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\VAKNWFT3\Swedberg - 2014 - The Art of Social Theory.pdf","","","abduction; analogies; analogon; analogy; Archimedes; art; Charles S.

"2N595RLS","book","2013","Cross, William P.; Katz, Richard S.","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy","","978-0-19-163800-8","","","","The Challenges of Intra-Party Democracy provides a comprehensive examination of both the concept and the practice of intra-party democracy (IPD). Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms — particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications. Comparative Politics is a series for students, teachers, and researchers of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics. Global in scope, books in the series are characterised by a stress on comparative analysis and strong methodological rigour. The series is published in association with the European Consortium for Political Research. For more information visit: www.ecprnet.eu. The Comparative Politics series is edited by Professor David M.

Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 10:04:07","2022-05-23 10:04:07","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UIMT5XFV","book","1998","Hutchcroft, Paul David","Booty Capitalism: The Politics of Banking in the Philippines","","978-0-8014-3428-0","","","","In the early postwar years, the Philippines seemed poised for long-term economic success; within the region, only Japan had a higher standard of living. By the early 1990s, however, the country was dismissed as a perennial aspirant to the ranks of newly industrializing economies, unable to convert its substantial developmental assets into developmental success. Major reforms of the mid-1990s bring new hope, explains Paul D. Hutchcroft, but accompanying economic gains remain relatively modest and short-lived. What has gone wrong? The Philippines should have all the ingredients for developmental success: tremendous entrepreneurial talents; a well-educated and anglophone workforce; a rich endowment of natural resources; a vibrant community of economists and development specialists; and abundant overseas assistance. Hutchcroft attributes the laggard economic performance to long-standing deficiencies in the Philippine political sphere. The country's experience, he asserts, illuminates the relationship between political and economic development in the modern Third World. Through careful examination of interactions between the state and the major families of the oligarchy in the banking sector since 1960, Hutchcroft shows the political obstacles to Philippine development.

He also offers an extensive review of the concept and rationale of the political party, and develops a sharp critique of various spatial models of party competition. This is political science at its best – combining the intelligent use of theory with sophisticated analytic arguments, and grounding all of this on a substantial cross-national empirical base. Parties and Party Systems is one of the classics of postwar political science, and is now established as the foremost work in its field.","2005","2022-05-23 10:17:10","2022-05-23 10:17:10","","","368","","","","","Parties and Party Systems","","","","","ECPR Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ywr0CcGDNHwC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=ywr0CcGDNHwC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This view is based on a narrow procedural definition of institutions that makes more sense in democratic than in authoritarian settings. While democratic institutions consist largely of procedures that constrain the executive's despotic power, authoritarian institutions consist primarily of organizations that enhance the regime's infrastructural power over political opposition. The practical significance of this distinction can be seen in the personalization of power in Malaysia. An aspiring autocrat ironically took advantage of highly institutionalized political organizations to enhance his personal power, even while maintaining the regime's resilience in the face of pressures for democratization.","2003","2022-05-23 10:22:21","2022-05-23 10:22:21","2022-05-23 10:22:21","81-101","","1","36","","","Iron Cage in an Iron Fist","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Comparative Politics, Ph.D. Programs in Political Science, City University of New York","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\P3NHGZWJ\Slater - 2003 - Iron Cage in an Iron Fist Authoritarian Instituti.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Incorporating new contributions from a group of young sociologists and many fascinating and novel case studies, Identity and Control is the only major book of social theory that links social structure with the lived experience of individuals, providing a rich perspective on the kinds of social formations that develop in the process. Going beyond traditional sociological dichotomies such as agency/structure, individual/society, or micro/macro, Identity and Control presents a toolbox of concepts that will be useful to a wide range of social scientists, as well as those working in public policy, management, or associational life and, beyond, to any reader who is interested in understanding the dynamics of social life.","2012-11-21","2022-05-23 10:23:28","2022-05-23 10:23:28","2022-05-23 10:23:28","","","","","","","Identity and Control","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","www.degruyter.com","","DOI: 10.1515/9781400845903 Publication Title: Identity and Control","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\KCGQ7LF2\White - 2012 - Identity and Control How Social Formations Emerge.pdf","","","Analogy; Asymmetry; Consideration; Emergence; Explanation; Formal organization; Governance; Heuristic; Ideology; Institution; Kinship; Organization; Participant; Politics; Result; Social actions; Social organization; Social relation; Social science; Social space; Social structure; Social theory; Sociology; The Other Hand; Theory; Trade-off; Accounting; Actor–network theory; Ambiguity; Bounded rationality; Calculation; Career; Case study; Causality; Clientelism; Colonialism; Complex society; Corporatism; Creation myth; Decentralization; Demography; Devolution; Dystopia; Embedding; Engineering; Externality; Grammar; Habitus (sociology); Hegemony; High- and low-level; Holism; Ideal type; Illustration; Inference; Information asymmetry; Interconnection; Jargon; Liminality; Management styles; Measurement; Medium of exchange; Michael Polanyi; Mimetic isomorphism; Mismatch; Modernity; Multiple discovery; Narrative; Obfuscation; Opportunism; Orderliness; Orwellian; Personhood; Plural society; Positioning (marketing); Prediction; Profession; Professionalization; Public sphere; Quid Pro Quo; Rational choice theory; Rationality; Rhetoric; Sensibility; Social constructionism; Social environment; Social reality; Sociocultural evolution; Sophistication; Stage theory; Structuring; Subculture; Superiority (short story); The Philosopher; Transfer pricing; Triage; Unbundling; Uncertainty; Venality; War; Working hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In December 2008 the National Democratic Congress (NDC) regained political power, and within months rifts appeared over the allocation of ministerial portfolios. The intra-party murmurings became public when two factions supported rival candidacies for the party's presidential nomination. The pro-Rawlings faction supported the candidacy of Nana Konadu Agyemang-Rawlings, and the anti-Rawlings bloc backed President John Evans Atta Mills. Drawing on Boucek's (2009) typology of factionalism, this article argues that factionalism within the NDC is a dynamic and complex process of informal groupings competing and jockeying for power to satisfy members' interests. It draws three conclusions: party factions are ad hoc groupings that are nurtured into a power bloc, and are constellated around particular individuals; factional conflicts are not rooted in ideology, but are based on differences in policy goals, interests and patronage; and, finally, factionalism fluctuates between cooperative and competitive phases.","2012-12","2022-05-23 10:26:30","2022-05-23 10:26:30","2022-05-23 10:26:30","573-601","","4","50","","","Party factions and power blocs in Ghana","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bridging existing literatures, the authors analyse dominant parties at national and sub-national, district and intra-party levels and take a fresh look at some of the classic cases of one-party dominance. The book also features methodological advances in the study of dominant parties through contributions that develop new ways of conceptualizing and measuring one-party dominance. Combining theoretical and empirical research and bringing together leading experts in the field - including Hermann Giliomee and Kenneth Greene - this book features comparisons and case studies on Japan, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Italy, France and South Africa.  This book will be of interest to students and scholars of political science, democracy studies, comparative politics, party politics and international studies specialists.","2010-06-10","2022-05-23 10:28:06","2022-05-23 10:28:06","","","390","","","","","Dominant Political Parties and Democracy","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oA3HBQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=oA3HBQAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Process / Political Parties; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these analyses largely overlook the process of candidate recruitment and selection, an issue intricately tied to political outcomes and the functioning of democracy. In this volume, a team of experts uses a common analytic framework developed by the editors to analyze the recruitment and selection of executive and legislative candidates in six major countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay. It does so from two perspectives. First, as a dependent variable, the volume explores the party and legal factors that drive the recruitment and selection process, thus producing particular types of candidates. It then considers candidate type as an independent variable, analyzing the impact of candidate type on campaigns, political parties, and the behavior of legislators and presidents once elected. The result is the first fully comparative inquiry into a central, but largely neglected, determinant of politics in Latin America.","2012-03-31","2022-05-23 10:29:33","2022-05-23 10:29:33","","","462","","","","","Pathways to Power","","","","","Penn State Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 6di7zeTbjIQC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=6di7zeTbjIQC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / Campaigns & Elections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Exploiting two recently built datasets that estimated the policy positions of Italian parties and factions from 1946 to 2010, we investigate if and to what extent factions bind the party leader in choosing the platform. We find confirmation for the idea that party positions are linked to factional preferences. Overall, the party works as a ‘bounded oligarchy’. Furthermore, the electoral payoff of party unity increases the impact of factional constraints when general elections approach. In line with the cartel party theory, however, autonomous leaders who are directly elected by a wider selectorate can get rid of factional ties choosing more moderate and vote-maximizing platforms.","2012-12-01","2022-05-23 10:30:27","2022-05-23 10:30:27","2022-05-23 10:30:27","689-701","","4","31","","Electoral Studies","Bounded oligarchy","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","","Italy; Cartel party; Content analysis; Downs; Factions; Party position taking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Characterised by its voluntary and highly personal but often fully institutionalised nature, it is a type of behaviour found in almost every human society. It touches upon basic aspects of the construction and regulation of social order and is therefore closely connected to major theoretical problems and controversies in the social sciences. This book analyses some special types of these interpersonal relations - ritual kinship, patron-client relations and friendship - and the social conditions in which they develop. The authors draw upon a wide range of examples, from societies as diverse as these of the Mediterranean, Latin America, the Middle and Far East and the U.S.S.R., in their study of the core characteristics of such relationships. They look at them as mechanisms of social exchange, examine their impact on the institutional structures in which they exist, and assess the significance of the variations in their occurrence. Their analysis highlights the importance of these relationships in social life and concludes with a stimulating discussion of the ensuring tensions and ambivalences and the ways in which these are dealt with - though perhaps never fully overcome. Patrons, clients and friends is the first systematic comparative study of these interpersonal relations and makes the first attempt to relate them to central aspects of social structure. It will therefore be an important contribution to both comparative analysis and social theory and will be of interest to a wide range of social scientists.","1984-10-18","2022-05-23 10:35:06","2022-05-23 10:35:06","","","356","","","","","Patrons, Clients and Friends","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=NWU-vE3SE9oC","","Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"C9GM5SGE","journalArticle","","Mukwedeya, Tatenda Godswill","Intraparty Politics and the Local State: Factionalism, Patronage and Power in Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality.","","","","","","The thesis observes that the ANC’s political dominance after 1994 saw the gradual conflation of the party and state partly through two processes related the party’s transformative agenda. Firstly, the state itself had to be transformed to reflect the demographic composition of the country and for the most part the ANC deployed its cadres into the state who could tow the party line. Secondly, the party relied on the state as a vehicle for redistribution and the transformation of the broader political economy to achieve equity and growth. Hence black economic empowerment, state preferential procurement and other policies to uplift previously disadvantaged social groups became stepping stones for the emergent African middle and upper class. Whilst these processes transformed the state, they also fundamentally transformed the party itself as it became a site of accumulation. Intraparty contestation intensified over the limited opportunities for upward mobility provided by access to the state. The thesis argues that factionalism increasingly became characterised by patronage as competing groups within the party sought to ring-fence their political power and the opportunities for upward mobility provided by the state. This was also compounded by deepening neoliberalism whose consequences of unemployment, poverty and inequality especially at the local level led to increased dependence on the local state and the development of factionalism based on patronage politics. The thesis then explores how patronage operates in everyday practice at the local level. It shows how patron-client relationships are not merely the exchange of state resources for political support but rather they embody a field of power relations (Auyero 2001). Evidence from Buffalo City offers an important insight into how patronage exchanges are preceded by complex relationships of power that are established over time and through various enactments. The thesis demonstrates how patrons, brokers and clients exercise various forms of power every day that inform inclusion or exclusion into networks for distributing scarce state resources. It challenges views that regard factionalism and patronage as elite driven practices.","","2022-05-23 10:40:53","2022-05-23 10:40:53","","249","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\22QJFYER\Mukwedeya - Intraparty Politics and the Local State Factional.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Where do new alternatives, new organizational forms, and new types of people come from? Combining biochemical insights about the origin of life with innovative and historically oriented social network analyses, John Padgett and Walter Powell develop a theory about the emergence of organizational, market, and biographical novelty from the coevolution of multiple social networks. They demonstrate that novelty arises from spillovers across intertwined networks in different domains. In the short run actors make relations, but in the long run relations make actors. This theory of novelty emerging from intersecting production and biographical flows is developed through formal deductive modeling and through a wide range of original historical case studies. Padgett and Powell build on the biochemical concept of autocatalysis--the chemical definition of life--and then extend this autocatalytic reasoning to social processes of production and communication. Padgett and Powell, along with other colleagues, analyze a very wide range of cases of emergence.

Acknowledging that IPD is now widely viewed, among both democratic practitioners and scholars, as a normative good, this volume suggests that there is no single, or uniformly preferred, form of IPD. Rather, each party's version of IPD results from a series of choices they make relating to the organization and division of power internally. These decisions reflect many variables including a party's democratic ethos, its electoral context, state regulation and whether or not it is in government. Individual chapters examine the relationship between party models and IPD, the decline in party membership and activism, the role of the state in regulating party democracy, issues relating to gender and party organization, norms of candidate and leadership recruitment and selection, party policy development and party finance. The analysis considers the principal issues that parties (and the state) must consider relating to IPD in each area of party activity, the range of options open to them, current trends in terms of paths chosen, what these choices tell us about parties and, most importantly, what the implications of these choices are. In doing so, we offer a common language and set of questions relating to IPD that enhance the ability for consistent evaluation of the state of internal party democracy. Through thorough analysis of associated costs and benefits, we also provide a framework to assist with considerations of IPD reforms — particularly in terms of their scope, the range of options available and their implications.

"2CFV629T","webpage","2014","Simral, Vit","The cost of partitocracy: party funding in East Central Europe","","","","","https://e-theses.imtlucca.it/154/","The work’s goal is to contribute to the discussion on cartelisation in the party systems of East Central Europe. Its contribution to the research field is to be found in a thorough analysis of the budgets of political parties in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, to a smaller degree also of the budgets of political parties in Austria, Germany and Slovenia. In total thirty arguments found in the existing scholarly literature are discussed, with a focus on their relation to budgets and election strategies of political parties. These arguments are analysed with the help of basic tools of quantivative statistical analysis and the qualitative method of comparison of selected features of the analysed cases. The work’s analytical part is based on two new original datasets. The first one, where data on budgets of political parties are collected, uses publicly available sources found in both the off-line as well as the on-line world of today. The second one uses original data collected by the means of an electronic questionnaire send to representatives of political parties in the six researched countries. The work defines two new concepts that serve as the theoretical basis of the analysis: the rule drive and the strategy drive. The rule drive is the part of a party’s budget that is predominantly formed by legal regulations on political parties, their funding and activities. On the income side, the rule drive is mostly visible in the share of party budget comprised by state subsidies. On the expenditure side, the rule drive is most apparent in the legal limits of expenses parties may allocate to election campaigning. In addition, the rule drive encompasses also the various limits on donations permittable to be accepted by political parties, limits on parties‘ business activities, or the legal fees that parties are obliged to pay to enter certain types of elections. The strategy drive is the causal agent that is predominantly formed by parties‘ free decisions on how they wish to conduct their day-to-day activities and their election campaigning. On the income side, the strategy drive is represented by the amount of membership fees collected, donations accepted or loans taken out. On the expenditure side, the strategy drive is the formula by which political parties allocate their financial assets to the various activities each political party carries out: office operations, administrative work for their elected representatives and officials, education of party members and promotion towards the public in general, election campaigning. Both concepts are of interest for the analysis and all their segments are used to assess the various structural features of party budgets. Original data collected for the work show that parties in their lifetime go through an evolution of their budgets, from one relying mostly on private donations and spending the majority of assets on elections to one relying on membership fees, state subsidies in the case of an electoral sucess, and spending a larger part of assets on activities not related to election campaigning. The specific shape of budget evolution depends largely on the size of their budget – parties with smaller budgets feature also a different budget structure than parties with budgets larger. This rule applies across the spectrum, from the largest parties in the dataset to the smallest one. The quantitative data on budget sizes are in the work translated into meaningful, categories based on budget sizes. , The categories are labeled weight classes, mimicking the weight classes found in the boxing world, from bantamweight parties, with annual budgets up to €10 thousand, to super heavyweight parties, with annual budgets over €10 million. All parties in the researched countries are thus be classified. Based on these categories, is it shown that the largest, super heavy parties in East Central Europe receive the bulk of all public funding. The model of subsidies distribution differs in the researched countries and the numbers show that it is difficult to assess whether one system is more cartelised than the other on the basis of distributed state subsidies. Easier and less arguable is to assess the relative transparency of the models of party regulations and regulations of party funding in each of the researched country. Austria, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia and Poland are in the recent time undergoing a turn towards more transparency, with new laws already in place or currently being adopted. The Czech Republic is noticeably lagging behind. The last phenomenon discussed in the work is that certain features of budgets, including its size and structure, correlate with certain party strategies. Parties of certain budget size and structure have different campaigning strategies, different policies and different opinions than parties of different budget size and structure. The collected data shows links between several variables, such as parties with large subsidies share in their budgets see as legitimate larger subsidies share than parties without subsidies, or heavyweight and middleweight parties spend a significantly larger share of their election expenses on the Internet than super heavyweight parties. Finally is discussed the behaviour of a specific set of parties that are in the researched dataset mostly found in the heavyweight and middleweight class. These parties have different campaign strategies, keep their election campaign spending higher than the rest and their budgets do not go through the same evolutionary shift as do the budgets of other parties. They do not increase their fee-paying membership and do not sustain significant day-to-day activities not directly related to election campaigning. These parties are since 2007 at the latest most successful in challenging the ‘cartel’ established by larger parties in national parliaments. The set of these parties overlaps in a large part with the set of ‘populist’ parties as discussed in other, ideology and party programme-oriented literature. Or, if restated, the populist parties are in their majority distinguished not only by their programmatic profile, but also by the structure of their budgets and related party strategy features. Ultimately, the work provides a lot of empirical evidence for the discussion of the concept of ‘cartel’ in the region of East Central Europe. It supports with hard data some of the old folk theorems and creates a firm data and conceptual basis for further research of party funding in East Central Europe.","2014-12","2022-05-23 10:46:26","2022-05-23 10:46:26","2022-05-23 10:46:26","","","","","","","The cost of partitocracy","","","","","","","en","info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess","Electronic Thesis or Dissertation","","","","","Num Pages: 153 Publisher: IMT Alti Studi Lucca","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\4CGHHKEW\Simral - 2014 - The cost of partitocracy party funding in East Ce.pdf; C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\SSBJHHM9\154.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It draws on fieldwork that included 71 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with party representatives and ordinary members (23 in Zambia, 24 in Burundi, and 24 in Togo). The interviews were conducted mostly in provincial urban centres over a period of four months in 2011 and 2012. The study conceives political parties as strategically acting organizations embedded in unique socio-political contexts; it argues that two hitherto neglected terms are especially useful for understanding and comparing them: cohesion and party-voter linkage. The argument is grounded on three key features of sub-Saharan party politics: a hostile operating environment, the prevalence of face-to-face political communication, and the supposed absence of ideology (which is re-interpreted as the presence of a single dominant ideology - development). The study conceptualizes cohesion as a prerequisite of Panebianco's (1988) institutionalization. A new, expanded classification of party – voter linkage types is formulated and a distinction is made between linkage proper and the genre in which it is enacted. Cohesion and linkage are combined in a comparative framework that enables generation of specific hypotheses about parties’ behaviour.","2014-01-22","2022-05-23 10:46:39","2022-05-23 10:46:39","2022-05-23 10:46:39","","","","","","","Political Parties in Zambia, Burundi and Togo","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.2483987","","C:\Users\seoul\Zotero\storage\4BARRIGV\Tobolka - 2014 - Political Parties in Zambia, Burundi and Togo Org.pdf","","","Burundi; cohesion; linkage; organization; Political parties; Togo; Zambia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2483987","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
