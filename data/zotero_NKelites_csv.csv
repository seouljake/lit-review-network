Using a measure of personalism constructed from historical data, we trace the consolidation of personal power in the North Korean regime and compare it to other communist regimes in the region to show how the evolution of personalist rule in these cases differed. We then explain this sequence of personalization in North Korea by showing how regime imposition by one foreign power, the Soviet Union, combined with military backing from a second foreign power, China, incentivized Kim Il-sung to consolidate personal control over the military and internal security apparatus by reducing the threat of military backlash.","2018-07","2022-03-31 16:23:50","2022-03-31 16:23:50","2022-02-01 01:17:07","157-180","","2","18","","J.

In the past, most such defectors came from privileged groups in the North Korean population, and their adjustment to the new environment did not pose a significant problem. However, from the mid-1990s, defectors began to come from the far less privileged groups. They experience serious problems related to jobs, education, crime, and social adjustment. Recent years have seen a dramatic but not always openly stated change in the official South Korean attitude toward defectors: from a policy explicitly aimed at encouraging defection, Seoul has moved to the policy of quietly discouraging it. There are fears that encouraging defection will undermine the policy of peaceful engagement with the North. There is also the perception that refugees are outsiders, not quite adjustable to the conditions of South Korean society and thus a social and budgetary burden.","2006","2022-05-23 11:09:32","2022-05-23 11:09:32","2022-05-23 11:09:32","105-137","","1","6","","","Bitter Taste of Paradise","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Lynne Rienner Publishers","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\XYG49PHX\Lankov - 2006 - Bitter Taste of Paradise North Korean Refugees in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An examination of North Korea's involvement in nonnuclear criminal activities shows that the DPRK has established sophisticated transnational smuggling networks, some of which involve terrorist groups and others that have been able to distribute counterfeit currency and goods on U.S. territory. These networks provide North Korea with a significant amount of much-needed hard currency, but the DPRK regime's control over them has decreased over time. These developments suggest that North Korea has both the means and motivation for exporting nuclear material, and that concerns over nuclear export from the DPRK, authorized or not, are well founded. When placed in the context of the global nuclear black market, the North Korea case suggests that criminal networks are likely to play an increased role in future proliferation. In addition, it raises the concern that proliferation conducted through illicit networks will not always be well controlled by the supplier state. It is therefore imperative to track and curtail illicit networks not only because of the costs they impose, but also because of the deterrent value of countersmuggling efforts. New strategies that integrate law enforcement, counterproliferation, and nonproliferation tools are likely to have the greatest success in addressing the risks posed by illicit proliferation networks.","2007","2022-05-23 10:52:47","2022-05-23 10:52:47","2022-05-23 10:52:47","80-111","","1","32","","","Illicit Activity and Proliferation","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\MH8NAPWX\Chestnut - 2007 - Illicit Activity and Proliferation North Korean S.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accompanying this threat, however, is the opportunity to gently draw North Korea into wider engagement with the international community. Halting progress toward peaceful reunification has been achieved, but more effort from external sources is necessary to accelerate the process. Among official U.S. agencies, only the military currently possesses the ability to subtly enhance the engagement process on the peninsula without any major concessions on its part. The author summarizes the geopolitical history of the peninsula, and addresses the issues confronting North Korea. He then proposes a model with which the U.S. military could bolster North Korean confidence in the possibility of reduced tensions on the peninsula without compromising its own security or readiness in any way. He bases the model on the precedent set by NATO during the decline of the Soviet Union. Aware that discussions of troop reductions, arms reductions, and the like are beyond the exclusive purview of the military, the author recommends modification to the schedule and scope of joint/combined exercises as the appropriate tool to influence the security environment in a subtle, yet, to North Korea, highly symbolic and significant manner.","1998","2022-05-23 10:35:48","2022-05-23 10:35:48","","","58","","","","","Dealing with Korea","","","","","U.S. Army War College","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: YX8jIDMscxkC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=YX8jIDMscxkC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design/methodology/approach—The authors apply the constructivist international relations (IR) approach and opt for the case study method based on semistructured interviews of individuals who have taken part in Swedish engagement programs. Findings—Besides having its embassy in Pyongyang and serving as a protecting power for the U.S., Sweden has provided capacity building programs for North Korean government officials and scholars and has taken part in low-profile human rights advocacy. In short, Sweden is best viewed as a facilitator between DPRK and the outside world. Its motivations are mixed and multiple, including rationalist pursuit of gains and the logic of appropriateness. Practical implications—Useful for policymakers interested in engagement DPRK and other countries with little interaction with the outside world. Originality/value—This case expands our understanding of engagement that is often understood to a great degree as a rationalist affair between the engaging and target states. It also affirms the usefulness of constructivist IR approach in accounting for today's engagement practices involving more stakeholders and less obvious costbenefit calculation.","2015","2022-05-23 10:26:31","2022-05-23 10:26:31","2022-05-23 10:26:31","42-62","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: McFarland & Company","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\Y2WMFCVW\Andersson and Bae - 2015 - Sweden's Engagement with the Democratic People's R.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is also true that the bilateral relations still remain far from satisfaction in terms of depth and degree of communication, crisis management, and a shared vision.Given Korean's psychological alertness and apprehension formed over a long history of contacts with China, differences in political system, mutual misperceptions, and degree of understanding, these problems cast serious challenges for future relations between the two countries. In the future, Korea-China relations could be sour and bumpy if the Korean government relies excessively on securityoriented approaches, centering on its alliance with the U.S. Korea needs to exercise a ""creative middle power-pragmatic diplomacy"" in dealing with China. The objective is to establish a positive-sum game in the Korea-China strategic cooperative partnership, extending consultation and cooperation beyond security issues on the Korean Peninsula. Both the Korea-U.S. alliance and the Korea-China strategic cooperative partnership should be the foundation of Korea's diplomatic assets, under which Korea would try to persuade North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. The substance of Korea-China relations will be determined by the policies of each government to consolidate the ""cooperative strategic partnership."" Sound communication, political will, and strategic management matter. The future relationship of Korea with China is at the crossroad among the ranges of being enemy, homager, or equal partner. Korea obviously favors the establishment of an equal partnership with China, based upon the common principles of mutual respect, cooperation, and co-prosperity.","2012","2022-05-23 10:14:30","2022-05-23 10:14:30","2022-05-23 10:14:30","47-62","","2","19","","","Enemy, Homager or Equal Partner?","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Institute of International Affairs, Graduate School of International Studies, Seoul National University","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\XHUBKHWA\Kim - 2012 - Enemy, Homager or Equal Partner Evolving Korea-C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Factor mobility is of critical importance.

With a monetary union and factor market integration, there is a significant impact on the South Korean income and wealth distribution.

This article reports on a multiyear study of experts dealing with security on the Korean Peninsula. It examines how experts learn and what can derail rational updating. Three factors common to much of the work in security studies contribute to the problem: the tendency to treat the intentions of other actors as unknowable private information that is beyond empirical examination; the inclination to believe that power provides a parsimonious explanation, even though it is multifaceted and dependent on numerous components; and the penchant for engaging in ""factor wars"" over which causal factors are most important while paying little attention to the cumulative and interactive effect of multiple factors. Collectively, these three factors produce overconfidence in hindsight and leave experts prisoners to their preconceptions.

When Kim Il-sung and his family engage simultaneously in encounters related to the security dilemma and major issues involving the succession, they provoke. When their political survival is threatened, they take a step back.

One must, however, understand North Korea's sociopolitical ideology in order to appreciate its inconsistencies as a regime. This paper will discuss the impact of North Korea's ideology in historical and sociopolitical context, as well as show the depth of ideological penetration into every layer of its society. The Juche ideology that has characterized the regime is a peculiar combination of nationalism, Marxism, and Confucianism. Since Kim Il-Sung's death, however, and the succession to power of his son, Kim Jong-Il, North Korea's ideology has metamorphosed into a series of sub-ideologies. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the process by which North Korean ideology changed and the paradox between the rise in ideological rhetoric and the weakening legitimacy of the regime under Kim Jong-Il.","2009","2022-05-23 09:54:44","2022-05-23 09:54:44","2022-05-23 09:54:44","46-61","","1","5","","","The Paradox of North Korea's Ideological Radicalism","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: McFarland & Company","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\YNBDEMN4\Lee et al. - 2009 - The Paradox of North Korea's Ideological Radicalis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such societies, norms of reciprocity (bao) are intense, but these norms are heavily shaped by the hierarchically structured network of social relations (guanxi) in which people are embedded, by the public nature of obligations, and by the long time period over which obligations are incurred through a self-conscious manipulation of face and related symbols. These special cultural symbols, as well as the historical monopoly of valuable resources by powerful leaders, help explain he origin of these patterns.

We draw on theories of authoritarian power-sharing to shed light on the evolution of politics in North Korea. Given challenges in collecting individual-level data in this context, we employ web-scraping techniques that capture inspection visits by the dictator as reported by state-run media to assemble network data on elite public co-occurrences. We test the durability of this network since Kim Jong-un's rise to power in December 2011 to find suggestive evidence of elite purging. Our findings contribute to the broader literature on authoritarian elite dynamics and to subnational studies on power-sharing in communist states.

Practical Implications—This study shows that Pyongyang, while increasingly bolder and determined in establishing economic cooperation programs with foreign actors, its economic policies remained determined by the quest for political and economic independence.

Carefully vetted prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup, the Dynamic Korea slogan was selected because it best captured the spirit of a modern, industrialized South Korea while concomitantly challenging former representations of South Korea as passive and isolationist. When the idea of the ""nation brand"" came into vogue, the national slogan was easily incorporated into South Korea's nation branding campaign in the mid-2000s. Several years later, however, the Dynamic Korea brand was effectively abandoned by the Lee Myung-bak (Yi Myŏngbak) administration. Concerns were raised over the possible negative associations of the word ""dynamic."" This article argues that the promotion and subsequent demise of the Dynamic Korea slogan were linked not only to the semantic ambiguity over the term ""dynamic"" but also to powerful sonic registers.

Design/Methodology/Approach—This paper is the only empirical and detailed examination of this issue of reducing hostility which is central to future U.S.-DPRK dialogue. Findings—The DPRK has sought a relationship with the United States to balance other powers since the end of the Cold War. By closely examining the March 31, 2012, Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement concerning U. S.-DPRK hostility it can be understood concretely what the DPRK means by peace regime, peace treaty, and ending the Korean Armistice Agreement. Practical Implications—Suggests a starting point for a comprehensive security settlement as it relates to the DPRK. A set of initial steps that can be taken to reduce U.S.-DPRK hostility is outlined. Relates the discussion of comprehensive security seulement and reduction of U.S.-DPRK hostility back to the regional geostrategic situation. Findings—Unless the leaders of both parties move toward a comprehensive strategy and look beyond narrow calculations of strategic options based only on a realist worldview, neither will be able to start a peace process that ends bilateral hostility.","2015","2022-05-23 09:24:13","2022-05-23 09:24:13","2022-05-23 09:24:13","79-102","","2","11","","","Overcoming U.S.-DRPK Hostility","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: McFarland & Company","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\3BLLMXRB\Hayes - 2015 - Overcoming U.S.-DRPK Hostility The Missing Link B.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By estimating where two factors will go, we can forecast North Korea's whereabouts. The future of nuclear weapons and Military First system will be influenced by North Korea's strategic options. The options which North Korea can choose are classified into 'transformation', 'compromise', 'bandwagon' by two variables such as regime security and economic recuperation. Firstly, 'transformation' is an option which North Korea's regime stability can be assured and its economy possibly restored by opening up to the world market. Following this option, North Korean regime will land softly by relinquishing its nuclear weapon program and dissolution of Military First system. Secondly, 'compromise' is an option which North Korea retains limited nuclear deterrence and pursues a limited open economy. By this option, North Korea will not abandon its nuclear weapons program but keep the rule of non-proliferation of WMD and pursue limited economic reform. However the possibility of North Korean regime's hard landing cannot be ruled out if U.S. economic sanctions against North Korea will continue. Lastly, 'bandwagon' is an option which North Korea still possesses its own nuclear deterrence and pursues dependent development by incorporating into Chinese economic bloc in the conflicts between the U.S. and China. However the possibility of this option comes down with growing the necessity of cooperation of two countries in the new Obama administration. It is desirable that North Korea chooses the option of 'transformation' for South Korea. However North Korea will confront the task how it retrieves of its inferiority in the area of conventional armaments in this option. North Korea has high possibility of the 'compromise' option by judgment of the recent North Korea's 2nd nuclear test. It cannot rule out the possibility of North Korean regime's hard landing though it also has the possibility of its muddling through.","2009","2022-05-23 09:21:56","2022-05-23 09:21:56","2022-05-23 09:21:56","69-102","","2","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Institute for National Security Strategy","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\UZDCSXP9\Cho - 2009 - NORTH KOREA'S SECURITY DILEMMA AND STRATEGIC OPTIO.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1990s, economic crises and famine led to predictions of the Kim regime's imminent downfall. Today analysts highlight impending famine as well as threats to the regime's position brought by eroding information control. Several theories of authoritarian control help to explain how Kim Jong-il and his family have remained in power and how this might change over time. The Kim regime has employed a variety of authoritarian ""tools"" to protect itself both from popular revolt and from internal coups. Its social policies, reliance on certain ideas and nationalism, and use of force prevent the onset of revolution. Through numerous other tools (elite co-optation, manipulation of foreign governments for financial aid, and the ""coupproofing"" of domestic institutions), the regime protects itself from coups d'état and elite unrest. This framework not only helps to explain the past resilience of the regime, but it suggests that the regime is not in danger of being unseated by coups or revolution. Yet it also suggests that the regime has not adequately prepared for succession after Kim's death. This analysis has implications for policy planning about the future of the Korean Peninsula, as well as for negotiations with and coercive strategies toward Pyongyang.","2010","2022-05-23 09:19:07","2022-05-23 09:19:07","2022-05-23 09:19:06","44-74","","1","35","","","Pyongyang's Survival Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\DZ48W62Z\Byman and Lind - 2010 - Pyongyang's Survival Strategy Tools of Authoritar.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such inducements, which include policy concessions and economic favors, can serve two main purposes: (1) arranging a beneficial quid pro quo with the other side, and (2) catalyzing, via positive engagement, a restructuring of interests and preferences within the other side's politico-economic system (such that quid pro quos become less and less necessary). The conditions for progress toward either purpose can vary, as can the requirements for sufficient and credible concessions on both sides and the obstacles in the way of such concessions. For renegade regimes, a primary consideration involves the domestic purposes that internationally objectionable behavior can serve. An examination of the cases of North Korea, Iran, and Libya finds that negative pressures have been relatively ineffective, suggesting that more attention should be given to the potential for positive inducements to produce better outcomes.","2010","2022-05-23 09:18:21","2022-05-23 09:18:21","2022-05-23 09:18:21","138-183","","1","35","","","Getting What You Want","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\XKG9UTR5\Nincic - 2010 - Getting What You Want Positive Inducements in Int.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, the literature on civilian-military relations provides few comparative examinations of the military's political role. In 27 chapters devoted to representative countries, this handbook looks at the varying roles the military plays around the world. Political role is defined as substantial and purposeful involvement in the making and allocating of wealth and social and political values. Using this definition, each chapter traces the historical background of civil-military relations in the country, identifies and analyzes the processes the military uses to exert political influence, evaluates the success and results of the military's political role, and projects future developments.As with any dynamic, organic body, the armed services in various countries change quickly and sometimes upredictably. The purpose of this book is beyond merely reporting whether a particular military is in the barracks as the 20th century draws to a close. Rather, the book offers analyses on the role that militaries have played in their societies, the historical forces that have shaped those roles, the socioeconomic constraints on them in the past, present, and anticipated in the future, and the current positions that armed forces have occupied in the last decade of the century.","1996","2022-05-23 09:06:26","2022-05-23 09:06:26","","","542","","","","","The Political Role of the Military","","","","","Greenwood Publishing Group","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: v9KzgdGV0l8C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=v9KzgdGV0l8C","","Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"HBTZP4P7","book","2017","Cavanaugh, Catherine","The North Korean Economy: Between Crisis and Catastrophe","","978-1-351-47826-7","","","","Viewed from afar, North Korea may appear bizarre, or positively irrational. But as Nicholas Eberstadt demonstrates in this meticulously researched volume, there is a grim coherence to North Korea's political economy, and a ruthless logic undergirding it--one that unreservedly subordinates economic welfare to augmentation of political power. Thus, paradoxically, even as official policies and practices consign the DPRK economy to a perilous realm between crisis and catastrophe, the country's leadership maintains unchallenged domestic control and has actually managed to increase its international influence.Through painstaking collection of hard-to-uncover data and careful analysis, Eberstadt provides a quantitative tableau of North Korea's terrible failure in its economic race against South Korea; its stubborn adherence to policies all but guaranteed to stifle growth and undermine economic performance; and the longstanding official effort to ignore, or mitigate, pressures for economic reform.Eberstadt is skeptical of optimistic accounts from South Korea and elsewhere suggesting that the North Korean leadership is interested in resolving the current nuclear impasse, and getting on with the business of reform and development. So long as Pyongyang's rulers entertain the ambition of reunifying the Korean peninsula on its own terms, Eberstadt argues, economic reforms worthy of the name will be subversive of state authority--and vigilantly resisted by Pyongyang's rulers. This authoritative volume has received widespread attention from Asian specialists, well as those concerned with nuclear proliferation and world peace, and international relations professionals in general.","2017-09-04","2022-05-27 04:59:23","2022-05-27 04:59:23","","","367","","","","","The North Korean Economy","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: yNszDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=yNszDwAAQBAJ","","Business & Economics / Economics / General; Business & Economics / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As conditions deteriorate in the ""hermit kingdom,"" the rulers of isolationist North Korea have begged their adversaries for food, energy, and financial assistance. As barriers break down enough to reveal the Norths dismal circumstances, the world is getting a glimpse of the regime's corruption, abject poverty, and political oppression.The stalemate on the Korean Peninsula is dangerous -- but prolonging the regime by supporting it is also dangerous. How should we deal with Kim Chong-Il's Korea? The answers lie in an understanding of how North Korea has dealt with the international community under the armistice, the uneasy truce in place since 1953.Over the Line is the first book to set out the record of North Korea's international negotiating posture during the armistice. James Munhang Lee and Chuck Downs draw important conclusions from the Norths manipulation of international talks and caution policy makers to be alert to the regime's negotiating tactics. AS a guide to negotiating with North Korea, Over the Line will provide policy makers with important background on how to deal with the rogue regime; in the event that the situation improves, the book will become essential reading for those who will deal with North Korea's emerging economic enterprises.The authors discuss examples of armed hostility initiated by the North, each of which became the subject of negotiations between the Pyongyang government and the UN Command, Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC). Using unpublished accounts from the UN Command, Over the Line brings together for the first time the full record of these negotiations, describes the motives and objectives, and assesses negotiating tactics.","1999","2022-05-27 04:53:30","2022-05-27 04:53:30","","","372","","","","","Over the Line","","","","","AEI Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: as5xAAAAMAAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=as5xAAAAMAAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; Political Science / Security (National & International)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"38D4AR5X","book","2015","Kriesberg, Louis","Realizing Peace: A Constructive Conflict Approach","","978-0-19-026642-4","","","","Early work in conflict resolution and peace research focused on why wars broke out, why they persisted, and why peace agreements failed to endure. Later research has focused on what actions and circumstances have actually averted destructive escalations, stopped the perpetuation of destructive conduct, produced a relatively good conflict transformation, or resulted in an enduring and relatively equitable relationship among former adversaries. This later research, which began in the 1950s, recognizes that conflict is inevitable and is often waged in the name of rectifying injustice. Additionally, it argues that damages can be minimized and gains maximized for various stakeholders in waging and settling conflicts. This theory, which is known as the constructive conflict approach, looks at how conflicts can be waged and resolved so they are broadly beneficial rather than mutually destructive. In this book, Louis Kriesberg, one of the major figures in the school of constructive conflict, looks at major foreign conflict episodes in which the United States has been involved since the onset of the Cold War to analyze when American involvement in foreign conflicts has been relatively effective and beneficial and when it has not. In doing so he analyzes whether the US took constructive approaches to conflict and whether the approach yielded better consequences than more traditional coercive approaches. Realizing Peace helps readers interested in engaging or learning about foreign policy to better understand what has happened in past American involvement in foreign conflicts, to think freshly about better alternatives, and to act in support of more constructive strategies in the future.","2015-03-30","2022-05-27 04:52:04","2022-05-27 04:52:04","","","512","","","","","Realizing Peace","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: IHGbBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=IHGbBgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / International Relations / Treaties; Political Science / Peace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These essays present the latest thinking on the Korean War, focusing on the relationship of one country to the war. William Stueck’s introduction and conclusion link each essay to the rich historiography of the event and suggest the war’s place within the history of the twentieth century. The Korean War had two very different faces. On one level the conflict was local, growing out of the internal conditions of Korea and fought almost entirely within the confines of a small Asian country located far from Europe. The fighting pitted Korean against Korean in a struggle to determine the balance of political power within the country. Yet the war had a huge impact on the international politics of the Cold War. Combat threatened to extend well beyond the peninsula, potentially igniting another global conflagration and leaving in its wake a much escalated arms race between the Western and Eastern blocs. The dynamics of that division remain today, threatening international peace and security in the twenty-first century. Contributors: Lloyd Gardner, Chen Jian, Allan R.

How can we explain the stability of Soviet military politics, asks Timothy Colton in his compelling interpretation of civil-military relations in the Soviet Union. Hitherto most western scholars have posited a basic dichotomy of interests between the Soviet army and the Communist party. They view the two institutions as conflictprone, with civilian supremacy depending primarily upon the party's control of officers through its organs within the military establishment. Colton challenges this thesis and argues that the military party organs have come to possess few of the attributes of an effective controlling device, and that the commissars and their heirs have operated as allies rather than adversaries of the military commanders. In explaining the extraordinary stability in army-party relations in terms of overlapping interests rather than controlling mechanisms, Colton offers a major case study and a new model to students of comparative military politics.","1979","2022-05-27 04:48:50","2022-05-27 04:48:50","","","400","","","","","Commissars, Commanders, and Civilian Authority","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: _HB_lAQlRdAC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=_HB_lAQlRdAC","","Political Science / General; History / Russia & the Former Soviet Union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As long as the balancing act continues to work, the dynasty, albeit defective, could survive in adversity for a longer period than expected.

In his international bestsellers The Tao of Physics and The Turning Point, he juxtaposed physics and mysticism to define a new vision of reality. In The Web of Life, Capra takes yet another giant step, setting forth a new scientific language to describe interrelationships and interdependence of psychological, biological, physical, social, and cultural phenomena--the ""web of life.""    During the past twenty-five years, scientists have challenged conventional views of evolution and the organization of living systems and have developed new theories with revolutionary philosophical and social implications. Fritjof Capra has been at the forefront of this revolution. In The Web of Life, Capra offers a brilliant synthesis of such recent scientific breakthroughs as the theory of complexity, Gaia theory, chaos theory, and other explanations of the properties of organisms, social systems, and ecosystems. Capra's surprising findings stand in stark contrast to accepted paradigms of mechanism and Darwinism and provide an extraordinary new foundation for ecological policies that will allow us to build and sustain communities without diminishing the opportunities for future generations.    Now available in paperback for the first time, The Web of Life is cutting-edge science writing in the tradition of James Gleick's Chaos, Gregory Bateson's Mind and Matter, and Ilya Prigogine's Order Out of Chaos.","1996","2022-05-27 04:33:11","2022-05-27 04:33:11","","","372","","","","","The Web of Life","","","","","Anchor Books","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: idDh0VYhsCIC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=idDh0VYhsCIC","","Philosophy / Social; Science / Chaotic Behavior in Systems; Science / General; Science / History; Science / Life Sciences / Biology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present paper is an overview which presents selected salient features of the larger model. Special attention is given to the specification of macrosociological variables which can serve as social indicators in a comparative framework of societal development. First, the goals of the SET model are stated. Then the basic model is sketched, and entropy is discussed as a measure of system state. Attention then turns to the specification of a holistic set of macrosociological systems variables. By seeking all correlates of the level (L), six salient global components are developed. These are population (P), information (I), spatial area (S), technology (T), organization (O), and level of living (L). This PISTOL (or PILOTS) model seems to be exhaustive and forms a comparative framework (when suitable indicators are specified for all components) for the analysis of social systems at all levels of development.

North Korea under Kim Jong Il examines how internal changes in North Korea since the early 1970s have structured that nation’s apparently provocative nuclear diplomacy and recent economic reform measures. To understand these changes, author Sung Chull Kim uncovers relatively unknown internal aspects of the country under Kim Jong Il’s leadership. His account, based on a thorough examination of primary sources, traces the origins, consolidation, and dissonance of North Korea’s systemic identity. He reveals how official and unofficial developments in the domains of North Korea’s politics, ideology, economics, and intellectual-cultural affairs have brought about system-wide duality, particularly between socialist principles embedded in the official ideology and economic institutions.Sung Chull Kim is Associate Professor of Northeast Asian Studies at the Hiroshima Peace Institute in Japan.","2012-02-16","2022-05-27 03:38:23","2022-05-27 03:38:23","","","297","","","","","North Korea under Kim Jong Il","","","","","SUNY Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=P3u7A04Cn-MC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Asia / Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I can genuinely say that I enjoyed reading the book as it took me stage by stage through a clear and easy-to-grasp understanding of the concepts and ideas of auto poiesis and then, as the book's title suggests, on through their applica tions. I found the summary in Chapter 12 particularly useful, helping to crystalize the main points of each chapter. The book conveyed enthusi asm for the subject and stimulated my interest in it. At times the book is demanding, but only because of the breadth of the subject matter, the terms and concepts associated with its parts, and the challenge of keep ing hold of all this in the mind at once. This is an exceptional text. ROBERT L. FLOOD Hull, UK Preface In recent years Maturana's and Varela's concept of autopoiesis, origi nally a biological concept, has made a remarkable impact not just on a single area, but across widely differing disciplines such as sociology, policy science, psychotherapy, cognitive science, and law. Put very briefly, the term autopoiesis connotes the idea that certain types of sys tems exist in a particular manner-they are self-producing systems. In their operations they continuously produce their own constituents, their own components, which then participate in these same production pro cesses.","2013-11-21","2022-06-03 06:18:21","2022-06-03 06:18:21","","","249","","","","","Self-Producing Systems","","","","","Springer Science & Business Media","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RAfyBwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=RAfyBwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General; Business & Economics / General; Social Science / Sociology / General; Science / Life Sciences / Biology; Business & Economics / Management Science; Science / Life Sciences / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A major advance in international relations theory, Regional Orders at Century's Dawn skillfully uses a key issue--internationalization--to clarify other recent debates, from the notion of a democratic peace to the relevance of security dilemmas, nationalism, and the impact of international institutions. The author discusses in rich detail the Middle East, Latin America's Southern Cone, and the Korean peninsula, and builds on examples drawn from almost every other region of the world.As Solingen demonstrates, economic liberalization--with its dramatic political and economic consequences--invariably attracts supporters and detractors, who join in coalitions to advance their agendas. Each coalition's agenda, or ""grand strategy,"" has consequences at all levels: domestic, regional, and international. At home, coalitions struggle to define the internal allocation and management of resources, and to undermine their rivals. Throughout their regional neighborhoods, coalitions opposing internationalization often compete for dominance, sometimes militarily. Coalitions favoring internationalization, instead, often cooperate. At the global level, each coalition finds support for its ""grand strategies"" from different international institutions and from competing global economic trends. Solingen's concept of ""grand strategy"" proposes more than a theory of foreign policy and explains the role of nationalism and ethno-religious revivalism in the politics of liberalization.","1998-09-13","2022-06-03 06:12:59","2022-06-03 06:12:59","","","356","","","","","Regional Orders at Century's Dawn","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: KiIfVFoUEsIC","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=KiIfVFoUEsIC","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In turn, this means that learning and innovation must play a role in the consumption process and that observed choices do not always reveal a consumer's underlying preferences. Some choices are made simply to try out new things and, whenever the consumer does not like the results, a choice will not be repeated.

Corruption is not, she argues, a unitary phenomena but rather consists of a variety of different forms of malfeasance whereby officials use the public authority granted them by right of their positions to seek private gains. Differences in form imply differences in result. Thus, we might presume it makes a difference if an official loots the treasury and absconds to the Cayman Islands or if she accepts a minor bribe in return for granting a business licence to an entrepreneur who goes on to establish a flourishing business empire.In trying to describe Chinese corruption, Sun faces a Herculean task. Since 1979, the Ministry of Supervision and the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission have disciplined three million cadres and the judicial Procuratorate has prosecuted one million cases of economic and disciplinary crime. Even given detailed and systematic data, the task of cataloguing the multitudinous forms of corruption and then characterizing them into a manageable typology would be a formidable analytic task. Such data are, however, lacking. Sun is therefore forced to turn to case data drawn from a variety of compilations and collections. These data are problematic – as Sun recognizes – because of sampling error and selection bias.Using her database (which consists of approximately 1,300 mostly senior-level cases), supplemented by data from official and unofficial Chinese sources, Sun breaks corruption down into two major categories, transactive and nontransactive, differentiating between exchanges between state officials and private interests (e.g. bribery), and the theft of state assets by officials (e.g. embezzlement). She then disaggregates these categories into 11 subcategories and 27 specific forms. She further differentiates between two periods (pre-1992 and post-1992) and breaks corruption down along regional lines.","2005-03","2022-05-30 07:20:47","2022-05-30 07:20:47","2022-05-30 07:20:47","177-179","","","181","","","Corruption and Market in Contemporary China.

"PWMTVUFZ","book","1993","Snyder, Jack L; Jervis, Robert","Coping with complexity in the international system","","978-0-8133-8607-2","","","","Prevailing theories of the international system reflect the bygone era of the bipolar Cold War stalemate. Understanding the complex new multipolar era requires a fresh approach. In this volume, Jack Snyder and Robert Jervis show why ultraparsimonious systems theories that focus on the balance of power among a few large states fail to capture the dynamics of today's highly interdependent, multipolar system. Taking issue with the accepted wisdom of the international studies field, Snyder argues that systems theories must address the interactions between international and domestic systems, and between military and economic systems. Using Robert Jervis's seminal essay on unintended consequences in complex systems as their point of departure, the contributing authors explore case studies of past and present multipolar systems to present analyses that challenge current thinking in international security and economics. Historical chapters show how understanding the workings of complex systems allowed statesmen to devise the Concert of Europe and how the collapse of the Concert in the Crimean War was triggered by the tsar's failure to comprehend the indirect impact his strategies would have on British public opinion. Another chapter highlights the feedback processes between domestic politics and the international monetary system that led to the rise and fall of the gold standard and to the creation of the European monetary system. The diplomacy of the Moroccan crisis of 1905 is used to show that conventional wisdom places unwarranted weight on a state's reputation for standing firm in the interconnected international system. The discussions also explore the systemic causes of World War II: Contributors examine how the international financial system unwittingly helped destroy Weimar democracy and offer a challenging reinterpretation of the workings of the balance of power in the 1930s. Qualifying the view that interdependence promotes peace, we see how German and Japanese economic dependence led them to adopt offensive military strategies. The contributing authors rebut currently popular arguments for collective security and trace the complex, unforeseen interactions between Europe's monetary system and its scheme for financing agricultural subsidies. The final chapter, tying all the case studies together, argues that the key to systemic stability is to provide security for the most vulnerable, important state in the system.","1993","2022-05-30 07:12:48","2022-05-30 07:12:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Westview Press","Boulder","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 26401787","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

He argues that the dynamics of economic globalization, new technologies, and evolving global norms are clashing with equally powerful localizing dynamics. The resulting encounters between diverse interests and actors are rendering the boundaries between domestic and foreign affairs ever more porous and creating a political space, designated as the 'Frontier,' wherein the quest for control in world politics is joined. The author contends that it is along the Frontier, and not in the international arena, that issues are contested and the course of events configured. The book examines a number of contexts and agents through which local, national, and international affairs are woven together.

When national leaders must win ratification (formal or informal) from their constituents for an international agreement, their negotiating behavior reflects the simultaneous imperatives of both a domestic political game and an international game. Using illustrations from Western economic summitry, the Panama Canal and Versailles Treaty negotiations, IMF stabilization programs, the European Community, and many other diplomatic contexts, this article offers a theory of ratification. It addresses the role of domestic preferences and coalitions, domestic political institutions and practices, the strategies and tactics of negotiators, uncertainty, the domestic reverberation of international pressures, and the interests of the chief negotiator. This theory of ""two-level games"" may also be applicable to many other political phenomena, such as dependency, legislative committees, and multiparty coalitions.","1988","2022-05-30 06:25:14","2022-05-30 06:25:14","2022-05-30 06:25:14","427-460","","3","42","","","Diplomacy and Domestic Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: [MIT Press, University of Wisconsin Press, Cambridge University Press, International Organization Foundation]","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\SKP9ANMV\Putnam - 1988 - Diplomacy and Domestic Politics The Logic of Two-.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article tracks and explains how Washington's nuclear threat cast a long shadow that underpins the evolution of North Korea's nuclear thinking and strategy over the years. North Korea's nuclear strategy is being shaped as much if not more so in Washington than in Pyongyang. Just as importantly, the implementation process of major denuclearization agreements has seemed ready-made to be hijacked by war hawks in domestic politics in Washington. In pursuit of these lines of reasoning, the article proceeds in three sections. The first section appraises the interplay of Washington's nuclear threats and Pyongyang's songun (""military-first"") politics in the evolution of North Korea's nuclear thinking and strategy over the years. The second section offers a critical analysis of the changing dynamics of domestic politics in the making and unmaking of key denuclearization accords in the course of the first and second U.S.-DPRK nuclear standoffs. The third section brings the common-security engagement back in charting an alternative pathway toward a working peace system in the Korean peninsula.","2010","2022-05-30 06:11:36","2022-05-30 06:11:36","2022-05-30 06:11:36","49-85","","1","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Lynne Rienner Publishers","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\A3GE732L\Kim - 2010 - NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR STRATEGY AND THE INTERFACE B.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They show how democratic governance is both preactive and reactive - creating interests and power as well as responding to them - and how it shapes not only an understanding of the past and an ability to learn from it, but even history itself. By exploring how governance transcends the creation of coalitions that reflect existing preferences, resources, rights, and rules, the authors reveal how it includes the actual formation of these defining principles of social and political life.","1995","2022-05-30 06:08:23","2022-05-30 06:08:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","Free Press","New York","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 32349561","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrary to this, we provide evidence that China’s planning system has been transformed alongside the economic transition, yet remains central to almost all domains of public policy making and the political institutions that have fostered China’s high-speed growth and economic stability. The incorporation of experimental programs into macro-plans, a tiered hierarchy of policy oversight, newly introduced mid-course plan evaluations, and systematic top-level policy review have allowed Chinese planners to play a central role in economic policy making without succumbing to the rigidity traps that debased traditional planned economies. By better understanding how the planning cycle influences incentives and resources of successive layers of bureaucracies and jurisdictions, and how it updates itself and adapts to new challenges, it is possible to explain a greater proportion of the Chinese policy-making process, including many of its successes and pathologies.","2013-11-01","2022-05-30 06:06:35","2022-05-30 06:06:35","2022-05-30 06:06:35","580-628","","6","39","","Modern China","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Inc","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\G4CW3RX8\Heilmann and Melton - 2013 - The Reinvention of Development Planning in China, .pdf","","","China; adaptive capacity; experimental governance; five-year plan; planning; planning cycle; policy making; policy process; policy review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The argument hinges on preference falsification-the act of misrepresenting one's preferences under perceived social pressures.

It addresses the reasons for the early successes of socialist systems, and the reasons for their gradual breakdown. There are twenty‐eight chapters, of which the first two (in Part One of the book) are introductory. The remaining chapters are arranged in two further parts. Part Two, (chapters 3–15), deals with classical socialism, defined as the political structure and economy that developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin and in China under Mao Zedong, and emerged in the smaller countries of Eastern Europe and in several Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Part Three, (chapters 16–24), deals with the processes of reform, such as the changes started in Hungary under Kádár in 1968 or in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev in 1985, which were designed to renew the socialist system. The final, political conclusion is that Stalinist classical socialism is repressive and inefficient, but nevertheless constitutes a coherent system which slackens and contradicts itself when it starts to reform; hence reform is doomed to fail. An appendix provides a bibliography on the post‐socialist transition.","1992","2022-05-30 05:55:40","2022-05-30 05:55:40","2022-05-30 05:55:40","","672","","","","","The Socialist System","Clarendon Paperbacks","","","","Oxford University Press","Oxford","eng","","","","","University Press Scholarship","","DOI: 10.1093/0198287763.001.0001","","","","","communism; classical socialism; failure; history; political economy; reform; socialism; socialist economics; socialist systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessing the competition between the North and South Korean economies from partition to the end of the Soviet era, Nicholas Eberstadt argues that the storyline is not quite as simple as the now-prevailing narrative suggests (that centrally-planned economies are doomed to fail against market-oriented alternatives). Rather, he suggests, the race for material progress was just that: a race, the results of which were far from preordained at the outset. In Policy and Economic Performance in Divided Korea during the Cold War Era: 1945-91, Eberstadt presents an impressive compilation of hard-to-find comparative data on economic performance for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (ROK, or South Korea) over two critical generations. By a number of indicators, Eberstadt argues, Kim Il Sung's North Korea actually outperformed South Korea for much of this period--not only in the years immediately following partition, but perhaps also into the 1970s. To explain these surprising results, Eberstadt details the impact of government policies on the course of growth of both economies and offers some unorthodox observations about material performance under these two contending polities. He finds that prevailing economic development theory on such issues as planned-versus- market economies, military burden, and the relationship between material advance and poverty, may require reexamination in light of the experience of the two Koreas between partition and the end of the Cold War.","2010","2022-05-30 05:54:58","2022-05-30 05:54:58","","","332","","","","","Policy and Economic Performance in Divided Korea During the Cold War Era","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 72lpTkNcJQ4C","","","https://books.google.kz/books?id=72lpTkNcJQ4C","","History / Asia / Korea; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Business & Economics / Economic Conditions; Business & Economics / International / Economics & Trade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Neither of these trends has taken hold in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which remains the worst kind of historical anachronism: a hereditary monarchy with the modern trappings of totalitarianism and a centrally mismanaged economy. Insecure both internally and externally, and ruthless in its pursuit of regime survival, the DPRK government has spawned two crises. The first is a domestic humanitarian disaster, caused by the government's massive failure to protect the human rights of its people. The second is a regional strategic crisis caused by North Korea's development of nuclear weapons along with the ballistic missiles that might deliver them.  Governments in the region recognize that the DPRK's prison labor camps are a moral outrage. They are also united in their opposition to North Korea's nuclear weapons program, although they perceive differing levels and types of threats from these weapons. There is a basis for coordinated action against a North Korean state that is extraordinarily weak in economic and diplomatic terms. Such action, however, has not succeeded in solving either the humanitarian or the nuclear weapons crisis. Nor is any breakthrough expected in the foreseeable future. The explanation is found in the differing agenda of the frontline states, which includes ""resident"" Asian power the United States. This book delineates the twin crises and analyzes the relevant interests and positions of other major states in the region, assembling a broad picture of the overall lack of policy convergence beyond agreement on a few general principles. This volume is unusual in its collection of a variety of national viewpoints on a single major international issue. It provides valuable insight into the ongoing problem of managing a recalcitrant North Korea within an otherwise modern and globalizing region.","2015","2022-05-30 05:44:50","2022-05-30 05:44:50","2022-05-30 05:44:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 908953529","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\PLTFB6W5\Vyas et al. - 2015 - The North Korea crisis and regional responses.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents an asymmetry–coercion linkage to explain the relationship between a great power and small states by reconceptualizing Albert Hirschman’s theory of trade dependency. This reconceptualization involves two tasks. First, the paper explicates vulnerability to coercion as a consequence of economic asymmetry, whereby a small state becomes susceptible to a great power’s compellence or co-optation to take a certain path preferred by the latter. Second, in demonstrating and measuring vulnerability to coercion, the paper accounts for the three factors: trade concentration, non-transparency, and reliance on bilateral aid. The combined effect of these three factors is that among the six countries under investigation, Cambodia and North Korea are extremely vulnerable to China’s coercion, while Vietnam is the least vulnerable state.","2019-12","2022-05-30 05:42:47","2022-05-30 05:42:47","2022-05-30 05:42:47","1950007","","04","55","","InS","China and Its Neighbors","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\PCLMQQPJ\Kim - 2019 - China and Its Neighbors Asymmetrical Economies an.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"IYJUZEH3","book","1999","Sigal, Leon V.","Disarming Strangers: Nuclear Diplomacy with North Korea","","978-0-691-01006-9","","","","In June 1994 the United States went to the brink of war with North Korea. With economic sanctions impending, President Bill Clinton approved the dispatch of substantial reinforcements to Korea, and plans were prepared for attacking the North's nuclear weapons complex. The turning point came in an extraordinary private diplomatic initiative by former President Jimmy Carter and others to reverse the dangerous American course and open the way to a diplomatic settlement of the nuclear crisis. Few Americans know the full details behind this story or perhaps realize the devastating impact it could have had on the nation's post-Cold War foreign policy. In this lively and authoritative book, Leon Sigal offers an inside look at how the Korean nuclear crisis originated, escalated, and was ultimately defused. He begins by exploring a web of intelligence failures by the United States and intransigence within South Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Sigal pays particular attention to an American mindset that prefers coercion to cooperation in dealing with aggressive nations. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with policymakers from the countries involved, he discloses the details of the buildup to confrontation, American refusal to engage in diplomatic give-and-take, the Carter mission, and the diplomatic deal of October 1994. In the post-Cold War era, the United States is less willing and able than before to expend unlimited resources abroad; as a result it will need to act less unilaterally and more in concert with other nations. What will become of an American foreign policy that prefers coercion when conciliation is more likely to serve its national interests? Using the events that nearly led the United States into a second Korean War, Sigal explores the need for policy change when it comes to addressing the challenge of nuclear proliferation and avoiding conflict with nations like Russia, Iran, and Iraq. What the Cuban missile crisis was to fifty years of superpower conflict, the North Korean nuclear crisis is to the coming era.","1999-07-21","2022-06-08 04:22:43","2022-06-08 04:22:43","","","336","","","","","Disarming Strangers","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wqYgEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wqYgEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"9D9KJW9L","book","2011","Eberstadt, Nicholas","The North Korean Economy: Between Crisis and Catastrophe","","978-1-4128-0947-4","","","","Viewed from afar, North Korea may appear bizarre, or positively irrational. But as Nicholas Eberstadt demonstrates in this meticulously researched volume, there is a grim coherence to North Korea&#39;s political economy, and a ruthless logic undergirding it--one that unreservedly subordinates economic welfare to augmentation of political power. Thus, paradoxically, even as official policies and practices consign the DPRK economy to a perilous realm between crisis and catastrophe, the country&#39;s leadership maintains unchallenged domestic control and has actually managed to increase its international influence. Through painstaking collection of hard-to-uncover data and careful analysis, Eberstadt provides a quantitative tableau of North Korea&#39;s terrible failure in its economic race against South Korea; its stubborn adherence to policies all but guaranteed to stifle growth and undermine economic performance; and the longstanding official effort to ignore, or mitigate, pressures for economic reform. Eberstadt is skeptical of optimistic accounts from South Korea and elsewhere suggesting that the North Korean leadership is interested in resolving the current nuclear impasse, and getting on with the business of reform and development. So long as Pyongyang&#39;s rulers entertain the ambition of reunifying the Korean peninsula on its own terms, Eberstadt argues, economic reforms worthy of the name will be subversive of state authority--and vigilantly resisted by Pyongyang&#39;s rulers. This authoritative volume has received widespread attention from Asian specialists, well as those concerned with nuclear proliferation and world peace, and international relations professionals in general.","2011-12-31","2022-06-08 04:21:42","2022-06-08 04:21:42","","","349","","","","","The North Korean Economy","","","","","Transaction Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eHQ3-Y9-AQYC","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The increase in social complexity, the authors of this volume contend, has reached a point where accepted concepts fail to describe social and political phenomena adequately. The studies in this book reevaluate traditional assumptions. Part One defines organized social complexity and discusses the effects of technological change. Part Two assesses national planning and systems analysis, approaches supposed to provide direct control over social matters. Part Three describes methodological aspects and research applications, and Part Four provides retrospective and prospective views of theories on social complexity.Originally published in 1975.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

"EXT3LVKQ","book","1997","Elliott, Kimberly Ann; Economics (U.S.), Institute for International","Corruption and the Global Economy","","978-0-88132-233-0","","","","The recently-adopted OECD convention outlawing bribery of foreign public officials is welcome evidence of how much progress has been made in the battle against corruption. The financial crisis in East Asia is an indication of how much remains to be done. Corruption is by no means a new issue but it has only recently emerged as a global issue. With the end of the Cold War, the pace and breadth of the trends toward democratization and international economic integration accelerated and expanded globally. Yet corruption could slow or even reverse these trends, potentially threatening economic development and political stability in some countries.  As the global implications of corruption have grown, so has the impetus for international action to combat it. In addition to efforts in the OECD, the Organization of American States, the World Trade Organization, and the United Nations General Assembly, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have both begun to emphasize corruption as an impediment to economic development.  This book includes a chapter by the Chairman of the OECD Working Group on Bribery discussing the evolution of the OECD convention and what is needed to make it effective. Other chapters address the causes and consequences of corruption, including the impact on investment and growth and the role of multinational corporations in discouraging bribery.

"TNJY4B72","book","2015","Lankov, Andrei","The Real North Korea: Life and Politics in the Failed Stalinist Utopia","","978-0-19-939003-8","","","","Andrei Lankov has gone where few outsiders have ever been. A native of the former Soviet Union, he lived as an exchange student in North Korea in the 1980s. He has studied it for his entire career, using his fluency in Korean and personal contacts to build a rich, nuanced understanding. In The Real North Korea, Lankov substitutes cold, clear analysis for the overheated rhetoric surrounding this opaque police state. After providing an accessible history of the nation, he turns his focus to what North Korea is, what its leadership thinks, and how its people cope with living in suchan oppressive and poor place. He argues that North Korea is not irrational, and nothing shows this better than its continuing survival against all odds. A living political fossil, it clings to existence in the face of limited resources and a zombie economy, manipulating great powers despite itsweakness. Its leaders are not ideological zealots or madmen, but perhaps the best practitioners of Machiavellian politics that can be found in the modern world. Even though they preside over a failed state, they have successfully used diplomacy-including nuclear threats-to extract support fromother nations. But while the people in charge have been ruthless and successful in holding on to power, Lankov goes on to argue that this cannot continue forever, since the old system is slowly falling apart. In the long run, with or without reform, the regime is unsustainable. Lankov contends thatreforms, if attempted, will trigger a dramatic implosion of the regime. They will not prolong its existence. Based on vast expertise, this book reveals how average North Koreans live, how their leaders rule, and how both survive.","2015","2022-06-08 04:12:24","2022-06-08 04:12:24","","","350","","","","","The Real North Korea","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FHpYCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Asia / Korea; HISTORY / Asia / General; POLITICAL SCIENCE / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"F5QL6UNR","book","2012","Lenin, Vladimir Ilyich","Essential Works of Lenin: ""What Is to Be Done?"" and Other Writings","","978-0-486-11981-6","","","","Among the most influential political and social forces of the twentieth century, modern communism rests firmly on philosophical, political, and economic underpinnings developed by Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, later known as Lenin. In this volume, comprising the four works generally considered his most important publications, Lenin presents the goals and tactics of Communism with remarkable directness and forcefulness.His first major work was The Development of Capitalism in Russia, written in prison after Lenin had been arrested for anti-government activities in 1895. Represented here by key sections, the book developed a number of crucial concepts, including the significance of the industrial proletariat as a revolutionary base. What Is to Be Done?, long regarded as the key manual of Communist action, is presented complete, containing Lenin&#39;s famous dissection of the Western idea of the political party along with his own concept of a monolithic party organization devoted to achieving the goal of dictatorship of the proletariat. Also presented complete is Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, in which Lenin examines the final &quot;parasitic&quot; stage of capitalism. Finally, this volume includes the complete text of The State and Revolution, Lenin&#39;s most significant work, in which he totally rejects the institutions of Western democracy and presents his vision of the final perfection of Communism.For anyone who seeks to understand the twentieth century, capitalism, the Russian revolution, and the role of Communism in the tumultuous political and social movements that have shaped the modern world, the essential works of Lenin offer unparalleled insight and understanding. Taken together, they represent a balanced cross-section of this revolutionary theories of history, politics, and economics; his tactics for securing and retaining power; and his vision of a new social and economic order.","2012-03-06","2022-06-07 15:49:05","2022-06-07 15:49:05","","","386","","","","","Essential Works of Lenin","","","","","Courier Corporation","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: PgplDI2qMnUC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=PgplDI2qMnUC","","History / Revolutionary; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Russia & the Former Soviet Union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The May 2012publication has been translated into English, with the aim to help the internationalcommunity better understand the northern half of the Korean peninsula. Englishtranslations of the referred editions will be published on an biennial basis.We hope that this book enables readers around the world to better grasp the reality ofNorth Korea. The regime in North Korea exhibits three characteristics: it is a totalitariandictatorship governed by the sole leadership of the suryǒng , who standsabove the Workers’Party of Korea (WPK) and the state; the regime, asone of the world’s most highly centralized and planned economies, hasadvocated self-reliance and the monopoly of all means of production bythe state and cooperative organizations; and the state uses the conceptof Grand Socialist Family which requires absolute obedience of peopleto the suryǒng , who is considered the father of a family. These traitsengendered a peculiar form of social structure unprecedented in anyother socialist country. As it had to do under Kim Jong-il, North Korea under Kim Jong-un mustengage in some degree of reform and opening to improve its economyand ensure the regime’s survival. Such a path, however, also brings withit the risk of regime collapse. The regime thus faces the difficult task ofmaintaining stability while at the same time reforming and opening up. CONTENTSI.

Drawing on decades of experience, noted experts Ralph Hassig and Kongdan Oh explore a world few outsiders can imagine. In vivid detail, the authors describe how the secretive and authoritarian government of Kim Jong-un shapes every aspect of its citizens' lives, how the command socialist economy has utterly failed, and how ordinary individuals struggle to survive through small-scale capitalism. Weighing the very limited individual rights allowed, the authors illustrate how the political class system and the legal system serve solely as tools of the regime.The key to understanding how the North Korean people live, the authors argue, is to realize that their only allowed role is to support Kim Jong-un, whose grandfather founded the country in the late 1940s. Still a cypher, Kim Jong-un, as did his father before him, controls his people by keeping them isolated and banning most foreigners. North Koreans remain hungry and oppressed, yet the outside world is slowly filtering in, and the book concludes by urging the United States to flood North Korea with information so that its people can make decisions based on truth rather than their dictator's ubiquitous propaganda.","2015-04-16","2022-06-07 15:44:39","2022-06-07 15:44:39","","","253","","","","","The Hidden People of North Korea","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 7T19CAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=7T19CAAAQBAJ","","Social Science / Sociology / General; Political Science / World / Asian; Social Science / Regional Studies; Social Science / Anthropology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compromise in Congress seems hard to reach. But do politicians deserve all the blame? Legislators who resist concessions and stand firm to their convictions might be doing just what voters want them to do. If this is true, however, then citizens must shoulder some of the responsibility for gridlock in Congress. This book challenges this wisdom and argues that Americans value compromise as a way to resolve differences in times of partisan division. Using evidence from a variety of surveys and innovative experiments, the book demonstrates that citizens want more from politics than just ideological representation - they also care about the processes by which disagreements are settled. Americans believe that compromise is a virtuous way to resolve political disputes. Because people's desire for compromise is deeply rooted in socialized support for democratic values, principled beliefs about compromise can serve as a check on partisan thinking. Across a range of settings, people's support for compromise persists even when it comes at the cost of partisan goals and policy objectives. People give warmer evaluations to members of Congress who are willing to compromise, and view compromise legislation as more legitimate. People care about not just outcomes, but also the way decisions are reached. Winning isn't everything in politics. People also value the democratic principle of compromise.""--","2020","2022-06-07 14:56:25","2022-06-07 14:56:25","","","223","","","","","","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: EM7AzAEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=EM7AzAEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QXUWXWCA","book","1991","Kim, Byoung-Lo Philo","Two Koreas in Development: A Comparative Study of Principles and Strategies of Capitalist and Communist Third World Development","","978-1-4128-4056-9","","","","The startling revolutions of recent years have had as great an impact on Northeast Asia as on Eastern Europe. Gorbachev&#39;s cautious withdrawal of support for North Korea and his establishment of ties with South Korea have created a need for a new research agenda exploring how communism and capitalism in Asia can be successfully restructured or redirected in a new world order. Focused on systemic issues, this book is the first study to attempt a comprehensive analysis of social and economic development in modem Korea as a whole.  As a homogeneous nation artificially divided by the competing ideologies of the Cold War, Korea provides a unique laboratory for comparing divergent development processes undertaken by conflicting social systems. Current theories of Third World development have advocated either capitalist models of modernization or have called for the establishment of self-reliant socialist economies cut off from the world capitalist system.  While capitalist South Korea has consistently outperformed Communist North Korea since the mid-1970s, development has not yet brought a fully evolved West-em-style democracy in its wake. &quot;Self-reliant&quot; North Korea achieved successful growth during its first fifteen years, but has since been faced with numerous structural limitations on sustained development, including severe restrictions on political freedom and civil liberties.  In the author&#39;s view, the experience of the two Koreas suggests that the solution to underdevelopment must be based on the realization that exclusionary theories need modification in the light of special historical and sociological circumstances peculiar to individual nations. This volume offers a valuable interpretation of modem Korean history and constitutes an important contribution to the comparative study of capitalism and communism in practice. It will be of particular interest to specialists in international relations and comparative political systems.","1991","2022-06-07 14:49:06","2022-06-07 14:49:06","","","260","","","","","Two Koreas in Development","","","","","Transaction Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RyAWLiPP58AC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=RyAWLiPP58AC","","History / Asia / General; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Wells","Fearing the Worst: How Korea Transformed the Cold War","","978-0-231-54994-3","","","","After World War II, the escalating tensions of the Cold War shaped the international system. Fearing the Worst explains how the Korean War fundamentally changed postwar competition between the United States and the Soviet Union into a militarized confrontation that would last decades.Samuel F. Wells Jr. examines how military and political events interacted to escalate the conflict. Decisions made by the Truman administration in the first six months of the Korean War drove both superpowers to intensify their defense buildup. American leaders feared the worst-case scenario—that Stalin was prepared to start World War III—and raced to build up strategic arms, resulting in a struggle they did not seek out or intend. Their decisions stemmed from incomplete interpretations of Soviet and Chinese goals, especially the belief that China was a Kremlin puppet. Yet Stalin, Mao, and Kim Il-sung all had their own agendas, about which the United States lacked reliable intelligence. Drawing on newly available documents and memoirs—including previously restricted archives in Russia, China, and North Korea—Wells analyzes the key decision points that changed the course of the war. He also provides vivid profiles of the central actors as well as important but lesser known figures. Bringing together studies of military policy and diplomacy with the roles of technology, intelligence, and domestic politics in each of the principal nations, Fearing the Worst offers a new account of the Korean War and its lasting legacy.","2019-11-26","2022-06-07 14:48:05","2022-06-07 14:48:05","","","503","","","","","Fearing the Worst","","","","","Columbia University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JcKtDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=JcKtDwAAQBAJ","","History / United States / 20th Century; Political Science / History & Theory; History / Military / Korean War","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Now, with historical material rearranged in chronological order, and with seven new chapters covering most of the last fifteen years, this edition brings the Soviet Union fully into the light of modern history and political science.The purposes of Fainsod's earlier editions were threefold: to explain the techniques used by the Bolsheviks and Stalin to gain control of the Russian political system; to describe the methods they employed to maintain command; and to speculate upon the likelihood oftheir continued control in the future. This new edition increases very substantially the attention paid to another aspect of the political process--how policy is formed, how the Soviet Union is governed. Whenever possible, Mr. Hough attempts to analyze the alignments and interrelationships between Soviet policy institutions. Moreover, he constantly moves beyond a description of these institutions to probe the way they work. Two chapters are devoted to the questions of individual political participation. Other chapters examine the internal organization of institutions and explore the ways in which the backgrounds of their officials influence their policy positions and alliances. The picture that emerges is an unprecedented account of the distribution of power in the Soviet Union.","1979","2022-06-07 14:13:37","2022-06-07 14:13:37","","","702","","","","","","","","","","Harvard University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 38gMzMRXCpQC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=38gMzMRXCpQC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"2HUUKM8D","book","1990","North, Douglass C.","Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance","","978-0-521-39734-6","","","","Continuing his groundbreaking analysis of economic structures, Douglass North develops an analytical framework for explaining the ways in which institutions and institutional change affect the performance of economies, both at a given time and over time. Institutions exist, he argues, due to the uncertainties involved in human interaction; they are the constraints devised to structure that interaction. Yet, institutions vary widely in their consequences for economic performance; some economies develop institutions that produce growth and development, while others develop institutions that produce stagnation. North first explores the nature of institutions and explains the role of transaction and production costs in their development. The second part of the book deals with institutional change. Institutions create the incentive structure in an economy, and organizations will be created to take advantage of the opportunities provided within a given institutional framework. North argues that the kinds of skills and knowledge fostered by the structure of an economy will shape the direction of change and gradually alter the institutional framework. He then explains how institutional development may lead to a path-dependent pattern of development. In the final part of the book, North explains the implications of this analysis for economic theory and economic history. He indicates how institutional analysis must be incorporated into neo-classical theory and explores the potential for the construction of a dynamic theory of long-term economic change. Douglass C. North is Director of the Center of Political Economy and Professor of Economics and History at Washington University in St. Louis. He is a past president of the Economic History Association and Western Economics Association and a Fellow, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has written over sixty articles for a variety of journals and is the author of The Rise of the Western World: A New Economic History (CUP, 1973, with R.P. Thomas) and Structure and Change in Economic History (Norton, 1981). Professor North is included in Great Economists Since Keynes edited by M.

"R6VEMQHH","book","2020","Milner, Helen V.","Interests, Institutions, and Information: Domestic Politics and International Relations","","978-0-691-21449-8","","","","Increasingly scholars of international relations are rallying around the idea that ""domestic politics matters."" Few, however, have articulated precisely how or why it matters. In this significant book, Helen Milner lays out the first fully developed theory of domestic politics, showing exactly how domestic politics affects international outcomes. In developing this rational-choice theory, Milner argues that any explanation that treats states as unitary actors is ultimately misleading. She describes all states as polyarchic, where decision-making power is shared between two or more actors (such as a legislature and an executive). Milner constructs a new model based on two-level game theory, reflecting the political activity at both the domestic and international levels. She illustrates this model by taking up the critical question of cooperation among nations. Milner examines the central factors that influence the strategic game of domestic politics. She shows that it is the outcome of this internal game--not fears of other countries' relative gains or the likelihood of cheating--that ultimately shapes how the international game is played out and therefore the extent of cooperative endeavors. The interaction of the domestic actors' preferences, given their political institutions and levels of information, defines when international cooperation is possible and what its terms will be. Several test cases examine how this argument explains the phases of a cooperative attempt: the initiation, the negotiations at the international level, and the eventual domestic ratification. The book reaches the surprising conclusion that theorists--neo-Institutionalists and Realists alike--have overestimated the likelihood of cooperation among states.","2020-06-30","2022-06-07 14:11:59","2022-06-07 14:11:59","","","322","","","","","Interests, Institutions, and Information","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: r9LgDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=r9LgDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Public Policy / Social Services & Welfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

J.","Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living","","978-94-009-8947-4","","","","This is a bold, brilliant, provocative and puzzling work. It demands a radical shift in standpoint, an almost paradoxical posture in which living systems are described in terms of what lies outside the domain of descriptions. Professor Humberto Maturana, with his colleague Francisco Varela, have undertaken the construction of a systematic theoretical biology which attempts to define living systems not as they are objects of observation and description, nor even as in teracting systems, but as self-contained unities whose only reference is to them selves. Thus, the standpoint of description of such unities from the 'outside', i. e. , by an observer, already seems to violate the fundamental requirement which Maturana and Varela posit for the characterization of such system- namely, that they are autonomous, self-referring and self-constructing closed systems - in short, autopoietic systems in their terms. Yet, on the basis of such a conceptual method, and such a theory of living systems, Maturana goes on to define cognition as a biological phenomenon; as, in effect, the very nature of all living systems. And on this basis, to generate the very domains of interac tion among such systems which constitute language, description and thinking.","2012-12-06","2022-06-07 14:09:58","2022-06-07 14:09:58","","","172","","","","","Autopoiesis and Cognition","","","","","Springer Science & Business Media","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: iOjVBQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=iOjVBQAAQBAJ","","Philosophy / General; Philosophy / Reference; Science / Philosophy & Social Aspects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Jack Snyder identifies recurrent myths of empire, describes the varieties of overextension to which they lead, and criticizes the traditional explanations offered by historians and political scientists.He tests three competing theories—realism, misperception, and domestic coalition politics—against five detailed case studies: early twentieth-century Germany, Japan in the interwar period, Great Britain in the Victorian era, the Soviet Union after World War II, and the United States during the Cold War.

"YSY2GIJ2","book","2013","Armstrong, Charles K.","The North Korean Revolution, 1945–1950","","978-0-8014-6879-7","","","","North Korea, despite a shattered economy and a populace suffering from widespread hunger, has outlived repeated forecasts of its imminent demise. Charles K. Armstrong contends that a major source of North Korea's strength and resiliency, as well as of its flaws and shortcomings, lies in the poorly understood origins of its system of government. He examines the genesis of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) both as an important yet rarely studied example of a communist state and as part of modern Korean history. North Korea is one of the last redoubts of ""unreformed"" Marxism-Leninism in the world. Yet it is not a Soviet satellite in the East European manner, nor is its government the result of a local revolution, as in Cuba and Vietnam. Instead, the DPRK represents a unique ""indigenization"" of Soviet Stalinism, Armstrong finds. The system that formed under the umbrella of the Soviet occupation quickly developed into a nationalist regime as programs initiated from above merged with distinctive local conditions.Armstrong's account is based on long-classified documents captured by U.S. forces during the Korean War. This enormous archive of over 1.6 million pages provides unprecedented insight into the making of the Pyongyang regime and fuels the author's argument that the North Korean state is likely to remain viable for some years to come.","2013-05-15","2022-06-07 14:08:04","2022-06-07 14:08:04","","","288","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eUf-_XACg3UC","","History / Asia / Korea; History / Asia / General; History / Military / Revolutions & Wars of Independence; History / Wars & Conflicts / Korean War","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the 1990s, economic crises and famine led to predictions of the Kim regime's imminent downfall. Today analysts highlight impending famine as well as threats to the regime's position brought by eroding information control. Several theories of authoritarian control help to explain how Kim Jong-il and his family have remained in power and how this might change over time. The Kim regime has employed a variety of authoritarian ""tools"" to protect itself both from popular revolt and from internal coups. Its social policies, reliance on certain ideas and nationalism, and use of force prevent the onset of revolution. Through numerous other tools (elite co-optation, manipulation of foreign governments for financial aid, and the ""coupproofing"" of domestic institutions), the regime protects itself from coups d'état and elite unrest. This framework not only helps to explain the past resilience of the regime, but it suggests that the regime is not in danger of being unseated by coups or revolution. Yet it also suggests that the regime has not adequately prepared for succession after Kim's death. This analysis has implications for policy planning about the future of the Korean Peninsula, as well as for negotiations with and coercive strategies toward Pyongyang.","2010","2022-06-07 14:04:33","2022-06-07 14:04:33","2022-06-07 14:04:32","44-74","","1","35","","","Pyongyang's Survival Strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: The MIT Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"AN6ELKB9","book","1998","Jervis, Robert","System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life","","978-1-4008-2240-9","","","","Based on more than three decades of observation, Robert Jervis concludes in this provocative book that the very foundations of many social science theories--especially those in political science--are faulty. Taking insights from complexity theory as his point of departure, the author observes that we live in a world where things are interconnected, where unintended consequences of our actions are unavoidable and unpredictable, and where the total effect of behavior is not equal to the sum of individual actions. Jervis draws on a wide range of human endeavors to illustrate the nature of these system effects. He shows how increasing airport security might actually cost lives, not save them, and how removing dead trees (ostensibly to give living trees more room) may damage the health of an entire forest. Similarly, he highlights the interconnectedness of the political world as he describes how the Cold War played out and as he narrates the series of events--with their unintended consequences--that escalated into World War I. The ramifications of developing a rigorous understanding of politics are immense, as Jervis demonstrates in his critique of current systemic theories of international politics--especially the influential work done by Kenneth Waltz. Jervis goes on to examine various types of negative and positive feedback, bargaining in different types of relationships, and the polarizing effects of alignments to begin building a foundation for a more realistic, more nuanced, theory of international politics. System Effects concludes by examining what it means to act in a system. It shows how political actors might modify their behavior in anticipation of system effects, and it explores how systemic theories of political behavior might account for the role of anticipation and strategy in political action. This work introduces powerful new concepts that will reward not only international relations theorists, but also all social scientists with interests in comparative politics and political theory.","1998-12-28","2022-06-07 14:00:08","2022-06-07 14:00:08","","","322","","","","","System Effects","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: whxsvjPzyGMC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=whxsvjPzyGMC","","Political Science / History & Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The socialist food distribution system collapsed primarily because of a misguided push for self-reliance, but was compounded by the regime's failure to formulate a quick response-including the blocking of desperately needed humanitarian relief. As households, enterprises, local party organs, and military units tried to cope with the economic collapse, a grassroots process of marketization took root. However, rather than embracing these changes, the North Korean regime opted for tentative economic reforms with ambiguous benefits and a self-destructive foreign policy. As a result, a chronic food shortage continues to plague North Korea today. In their carefully researched book, Stephan Haggard and Marcus Noland present the most comprehensive and penetrating account of the famine to date, examining not only the origins and aftermath of the crisis but also the regime's response to outside aid and the effect of its current policies on the country's economic future. Their study begins by considering the root causes of the famine, weighing the effects of the decline in the availability of food against its poor distribution. Then it takes a close look at the aid effort, addressing the difficulty of monitoring assistance within the country, and concludes with an analysis of current economic reforms and strategies of engagement.North Korea's famine exemplified the depredations that can arise from tyrannical rule and the dilemmas such regimes pose for the humanitarian community, as well as the obstacles inherent in achieving economic and political reform. To reveal the state's culpability in this tragic event is a vital project of historical recovery, one that is especially critical in light of our current engagement with the ""North Korean question.""","2007","2022-06-07 13:54:32","2022-06-07 13:54:32","","","337","","","","","Famine in North Korea","","","","","Columbia University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=2-0JxJ9RxnsC","","Social Science / General; Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It finds that where social, economic, and technocratic ties to the West were extensive, as in Eastern Europe and the Americas, the external cost of abuse led incumbents to cede power rather than crack down, which led to democratization. Where ties to the West were limited, external democratizing pressure was weaker and countries rarely democratized. In these cases, regime outcomes hinged on the character of state and ruling party organizations. Where incumbents possessed developed and cohesive coercive party structures, they could thwart opposition challenges, and competitive authoritarian regimes survived; where incumbents lacked such organizational tools, regimes were unstable but rarely democratized.","2010-08-16","2022-06-08 05:20:34","2022-06-08 05:20:34","","","537","","","","","Competitive Authoritarianism","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: NZDI05p1PDgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=NZDI05p1PDgC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Modern / 20th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"K7XPRFT6","book","2004","Wit, Joel S.; Poneman, Daniel B.; Gallucci, Robert L.","Going Critical: The First North Korean Nuclear Crisis","","978-0-8157-9641-1","","","","A decade before being proclaimed part of the ""axis of evil,"" North Korea raised alarms in Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo as the pace of its clandestine nuclear weapons program mounted. When confronted by evidence of its deception in 1993, Pyongyang abruptly announced its intention to become the first nation ever to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, defying its earlier commitments to submit its nuclear activities to full international inspections. U.S. intelligence had revealed evidence of a robust plutonium production program. Unconstrained, North Korea's nuclear factory would soon be capable of building about thirty Nagasaki-sized nuclear weapons annually. The resulting arsenal would directly threaten the security of the United States and its allies, while tempting cash-starved North Korea to export its deadly wares to America's most bitter adversaries. In Go ing Critical, three former U.S. officials who played key roles in the nuclear crisis trace the intense efforts that led North Korea to freeze—and pledge ultimately to dismantle—its dangerous plutonium production program under international inspection, while the storm clouds of a second Korean War gathered. Drawing on international government documents, memoranda, cables, and notes, the authors chronicle the complex web of diplomacy--from Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing to Geneva, Moscow, and Vienna and back again—that led to the negotiation of the 1994 Agreed Framework intended to resolve this nuclear standoff. They also explore the challenge of weaving together the military, economic, and diplomatic instruments employed to persuade North Korea to accept significant constraints on its nuclear activities, while deterring rather than provoking a violent North Korean response. Some ten years after these intense negotiations, the Agreed Framework lies abandoned. North Korea claims to possess some nuclear weapons, while threatening to produce even more. The story of the 1994 confrontation provides important lessons for the United States as it grapples once again with a nuclear crisis on a peninsula that half a century ago claimed more than 50,000 American lives and today bristles with arms along the last frontier of the cold war: the De-Militarized Zone separating North and South Korea.","2004-04-19","2022-06-08 05:24:36","2022-06-08 05:24:36","","","526","","","","","Going Critical","","","","","Brookings Institution Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 2JNzKbLZVS4C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=2JNzKbLZVS4C","","Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / International Relations / Arms Control; Political Science / International Relations / Diplomacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the past half century he has created an audience for his work which is truly global, and he has marked the way in which the history of political thought is studied as deeply and personally as any historian of the period. The essays in this major new collection are selected from a lifetime of thinking about political thought, and how we should study it in history. What in fact does it mean to write the history of a political society, and what kind of political thought is this? Professor Pocock emphasises both the theory and practice of political thought considered as action in history, and the political theory of historiography considered as a form of political thought. Together these essays constitute a collection that any serious student of politics and intellectual history needs to possess.","2009-02-05","2022-06-08 05:34:04","2022-06-08 05:34:04","","","278","","","","","Political Thought and History","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: itGQBx7o7pEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=itGQBx7o7pEC","","History / Social History; Political Science / History & Theory; History / World","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methods discussed include contractualism, reflective equilibrium, positive political theory, thought experiments and ideological analysis. Many discussions of political theory methods describe and justify these methods with little or no discussion of their application, emphasizing 'what is' and 'why do' over 'how to'. This book covers all three. Each chapter explains what kinds of problems in political theory might require researchers to use a particular method, the basic principles behind the method being proposed, and an analysis of how to apply it, including concrete principles of good practice. The book thus summarizes methodological ideas, grouped in one place and made accessible to students, and it makes innovative contributions to research methods in analytical political theory.","2017-05-18","2022-06-08 05:33:56","2022-06-08 05:33:56","","","347","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ms8oDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ms8oDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"MTSU4Q72","book","2015","Lee, Terence","Defect Or Defend: Military Responses to Popular Protests in Authoritarian Asia","","978-1-4214-1516-1","","","","Why do certain militaries brutally suppress popular demonstrations, while others support the path to political liberalization by backing mass social movements?Although social movements and media can help destabilize authoritarian governments, not all social protest is effective or culminates in the toppling of dictatorships. Frequently, the military’s response determines the outcome. In Defect or Defend, Terence Lee uses four case studies from Asia to provide insight into the military’s role during the transitional phase of regime change. Lee compares popular uprisings in the Philippines and Indonesia—both of which successfully engaged military support to bring down authoritarian rule—with protest movements in China and Burma which were violently suppressed by military forces. Lee’s theory of “high personalism” and power-sharing among the armed forces leadership provides a framework for understanding the critical transitory phases of democratization. He uses this theory to review and assess Eastern Europe’s democratization events in 1989, the Colored Revolutions of the early 2000s, and the protests and revolutions unfolding in the Middle East. This book will appeal to students and scholars of comparative politics, Asian studies, security studies, and international relations, as well as defense policymakers.","2015","2022-06-09 08:49:25","2022-06-09 08:49:25","","","265","","","","","Defect Or Defend","","","","","JHU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Ob1TBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Ob1TBgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Security (National & International); Political Science / World / Asian; History / Military / Strategy; BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY / Presidents & Heads of State","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"IN5FMM98","book","2011","Eberstadt, Nicholas","The North Korean Economy: Between Crisis and Catastrophe","","978-1-4128-0947-4","","","","Viewed from afar, North Korea may appear bizarre, or positively irrational. But as Nicholas Eberstadt demonstrates in this meticulously researched volume, there is a grim coherence to North Korea&#39;s political economy, and a ruthless logic undergirding it--one that unreservedly subordinates economic welfare to augmentation of political power. Thus, paradoxically, even as official policies and practices consign the DPRK economy to a perilous realm between crisis and catastrophe, the country&#39;s leadership maintains unchallenged domestic control and has actually managed to increase its international influence. Through painstaking collection of hard-to-uncover data and careful analysis, Eberstadt provides a quantitative tableau of North Korea&#39;s terrible failure in its economic race against South Korea; its stubborn adherence to policies all but guaranteed to stifle growth and undermine economic performance; and the longstanding official effort to ignore, or mitigate, pressures for economic reform. Eberstadt is skeptical of optimistic accounts from South Korea and elsewhere suggesting that the North Korean leadership is interested in resolving the current nuclear impasse, and getting on with the business of reform and development. So long as Pyongyang&#39;s rulers entertain the ambition of reunifying the Korean peninsula on its own terms, Eberstadt argues, economic reforms worthy of the name will be subversive of state authority--and vigilantly resisted by Pyongyang&#39;s rulers. This authoritative volume has received widespread attention from Asian specialists, well as those concerned with nuclear proliferation and world peace, and international relations professionals in general.","2011-12-31","2022-06-09 08:43:11","2022-06-09 08:43:11","","","349","","","","","The North Korean Economy","","","","","Transaction Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eHQ3-Y9-AQYC","","Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"7CFNZ2MZ","book","2021","Baturo, Alexander; Elkink, Jos","The New Kremlinology: Understanding Regime Personalization in Russia","","978-0-19-264993-5","","","","The New Kremlinology is the first in-depth examination of the development of regime personalization in Russia. In the post-Cold War period, many previously democratizing countries experienced authoritarian reversals whereby incumbent leaders took over and gravitated towards personalist rule. Scholars have predominantly focused on the authoritarian turn, as opposed to the type of authoritarian rule emerging from it. In a departure from accounts centred on the failure of democratization in Russia, this book's argument begins from the assumption that the political regime of Vladimir Putin is a personalist regime in the making. Focusing on the politics within the Russian ruling coalition since 1999, The New Kremlinology describes the process of regime personalization, that is, the acquisition of personal power by a leader. Drawing from comparative evidence and theories of personalist rule, the investigation is based on four components of regime personalization: patronage networks, deinstitutionalization, media personalization, and establishing permanency in office. The fact that Russia has gradually acquired many, but not all of, the characteristics associated with a personalist regime, underscores the complexity of political change and the need to unpack the concept of personalism. The lessons of the book extend beyond Russia and illuminate how other personalist and personalizing regimes emerge and develop. Furthermore, the title of the book, The New Kremlinology, is chosen to emphasize not only the subject matter, the what, but also the how the battery of innovative methods employed to study the black box of non-democratic politics. Comparative Politics is a series for researchers, teachers, and students of political science that deals with contemporary government and politics.

Researchers Allison Davis, Burleigh B. Gardner, and Mary R. Gardner lived among the people of Natchez, Mississippi, as they investigated how class and caste informed daily life in a typical southern community. This Southern Classics edition of their study offers contemporary students of history a provocative collection of primary material gathered by conscientious and well-trained participant-observers, who found then, as now, intertwined social and economic inequalities at the root of racial tensions. Expanding on earlier studies of community stratification by social class, researchers in the Deep South Project introduced the additional concept of caste, which parsed a community through rigid social ranks assigned at birth and unalterable through life, a concept readily identifiable in the racial divisions of the Jim Crow South. As African American researchers, Davis and his wife, Elizabeth, along with his assistant St. Clair Drake, were able to gain unrivaled access to the black community in rural Mississippi, unavailable to their white counterparts. Through their interviews and experiences, the authors vividly capture the nuances in caste-enforcing systems of tenant-landlord relations, local government, and law enforcement. But the chief achievement of Deep South is its rich analysis of how the southern economic system, and sharecropping in particular, functioned to maintain rigid caste divisions along racial lines. In the new introduction to this edition, Jennifer Jensen Wallach situates this germinal study within the field of social anthropology and against the backdrop of similar community studies of the era. She also details the subsequent careers of this distinguished team of researchers.","2009","2022-06-09 07:50:42","2022-06-09 07:50:42","","","604","","","","","Deep South","","","","","Univ of South Carolina Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Q3b9QTOgLFcC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Q3b9QTOgLFcC","","Social Science / Regional Studies; History / United States / State & Local / South (AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, NC, SC, TN, VA, WV); Social Science / Ethnic Studies / American / African American & Black Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a nightmare of political theory stretched to madness, North Korea's Kim Jong Il made himself into a living god, surrounded by lies and flattery and beyond criticism. As over two million of his subjects starved to death, Kim Jong Il roamed between palaces staffed by the most beautiful girls in the country and stocked with the most expensive delicacies from around the world. Outside, the steel mills shut down, the trains stopped running, the power went out, and the hospitals ran out of medicine. When the population threatened to revolt, Kim imposed a reign of terror across the country, deceived the United Nations, and plundered the country's dwindling resources to become a nuclear power. Now tiny bankrupt North Korea is using her nuclear capability to blackmail the United States.Veteran correspondent Jasper Becker takes us inside one of the most secretive countries in the world, exposing the internal chaos, blind faith, rampant corruption, and terrifying cruelty of its rulers. Becker details the vain efforts to change North Korea by actors inside and outside the country and the dangers this highly volatile country continues to pose. Small, podgy and easily overlooked, Kim Jong Il has emerged from the shadow of his father to lead the most successful and dangerous rogue state of our times.This unique land, ruled by one family's megalomania and paranoia, seems destined to survive and linger on for some time, a menace to its own people and to the rest of the world. But should the nations of the world allow this regime to survive? That's the question with which this book concludes.","2005-05","2022-06-09 07:10:56","2022-06-09 07:10:56","","","326","","","","","Rogue Regime","","","","","Oxford University Press, USA","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: XYnBBoT3HRUC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=XYnBBoT3HRUC","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Security (National & International); History / Asia / Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contrary to expectations, he has succeeded in maintaining enough political stability to remain in power. Kim Jong Il's Leadership of North Korea is an examination of how political power has been developed, transmitted from father to son, and now operates in North Korea Using a variety of original North Korean sources as well as South Korean materials Jae-Cheon Lim pieces together the ostensibly contradictory and inconsistent facts into a conceptual coherent framework. This book considers Kim and his leadership through an analytical framework. composed of four main elements: i) Kim as a leader of a totalitarian society; ii) as a politician; iii) as a Korean; and iv) as an individual person. This illuminating account of what constitutes power and how it is used makes an important contribution to the understanding of an opaque and difficult regime. It will be of interest for upper level undergraduate, postgraduates and academics interested in North Korean politics, and also those in Political theory.","2009-01-01","2022-06-09 07:07:10","2022-06-09 07:07:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","DOI: 10.4324/9780203884720","","","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271770168_Kim_Jong_Il's_Leadership_of_North_Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We draw on theories of authoritarian power-sharing to shed light on the evolution of politics in North Korea. Given challenges in collecting individual-level data in this context, we employ web-scraping techniques that capture inspection visits by the dictator as reported by state-run media to assemble network data on elite public co-occurrences. We test the durability of this network since Kim Jong-un's rise to power in December 2011 to find suggestive evidence of elite purging. Our findings contribute to the broader literature on authoritarian elite dynamics and to subnational studies on power-sharing in communist states. Importantly, our approach helps bring the study of North Korean politics more firmly in the mainstream of political science inquiry.","2019-01-01","2022-06-09 07:04:18","2022-06-09 07:04:18","","","","","52","","Comparative Politics","Dynamics of the Inner Elite in Dictatorships","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\6UE9QWQ5\Mahdavi and John - 2019 - Dynamics of the Inner Elite in Dictatorships Evid.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335379798_Dynamics_of_the_Inner_Elite_in_Dictatorships_Evidence_from_North_Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pyongyang is the country’s capital and largest city. To the north and northwest, the country is bordered by China and by Russia along the Amnok and Tumen rivers; it is bordered to the south by South Korea, with the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone separating the two. Nevertheless, North Korea, like its southern counterpart, claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. Both North Korea and South Korea became members of the UN in 1991. Applying the role theoretical approach to North Korea for the first time, this book charts the continuities and changes in North Korean foreign policy, drawing on content analysis of North Korean periodicals. It begins with an identification of roles, before analysing the relationship between these roles and foreign policy in practice. In particular, it examines the links between role shifts and changes in interaction with the U.S. and South Korea. This book also demonstrates that the existence of pressure, sanctions and confrontations have contributed to a confrontational, isolationist and inward-looking foreign policy. Therefore, it argues, one should be aware that if the DPRK is constantly treated as if it is a nuclear state – and even a rogue state – it is much easier for it to enact a role on the international stage which reflects this. As a study of the foreign policy of the world’s most controversial and secretive country, this book will be invaluable to students and scholars of Korean politics and international relations, as well as Asian Studies more generally.","2018-10-12","2022-06-09 07:03:20","2022-06-09 07:03:20","","","227","","","","","North Korea's Foreign Policy","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: nNNyDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=nNNyDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / World / Asian; Social Science / Regional Studies; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General; Political Science / World / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YST2TMIV","book","2010","Nye, Joseph S.","The Powers to Lead","","978-0-19-975413-7","","","","With The Powers to Lead, Joseph S. Nye Jr. offers a sweeping look at the nature of leadership in today's world, in an illuminating blend of history, business case studies, psychological research, and more. As he observes, many now believe that the more authoritarian and coercive forms of leadership--the ""hard power"" approaches of earlier military-industrial eras--have been largely supplanted in postindustrial societies by ""soft power"" approaches that seek to attract, inspire, and persuade rather than dictate. Nye argues, however, that the most effective leaders are actually those who combine hard and soft power skills in proportions that vary with different situations. He calls this ""smart power."" Drawing examples from the careers of leaders as disparate as Gandhi, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lee Iacocca, and--in a new preface--Barack Obama, Nye uses the concept of smart power to shed light on such topics as leadership types and skills, the needs and demands of followers, and the nature of good and bad leadership in terms of both ethics and effectiveness. In one particularly instructive chapter, he looks in depth at ""contextual intelligence""--the ability to understand changing environments, capitalize on trends, and use the flow of events to implement strategies. Thoroughly grounded in the real world, rich in both analysis and anecdote, The Powers to Lead is sure to become a modern classic, a concise and lucid work applicable to every field, from small businesses to nations on the world stage. ""Mr. Nye has performed a valuable service in rounding up and summarizing the various academic studies and theories of leadership into a single, slim volume."" --The Economist ""One of the first to include new scholarship on the youngest emerging leaders, Nye readily demonstrates his ability to traverse the intellectual and pragmatic without becoming esoteric or pedantic.... Highly recommended."" --CHOICE ""Finally, a book that analyzes what leadership really means and how it relates to power. It will be invaluable for both political and business leaders alike. Nye developed the concept of hard and soft power, and now he shows how the best leaders use both in a smart way."" -Walter Isaacson, author of Einstein: His Life and Universe ""An outstanding primer on leadership and all its dimensions.

The 'leadership issue' has become key and this will be the first specific examination of leadership in the light of Mandela's legacy and its effect on his successor as potential and actual leaders - all in 'the shadow of Mandela' as the architect of the transition from apartheid to democracy, and with overarching moral authority and international reputation. Alexander Johnston shows how his successors are judged against Mandela's achievements, including the potentially impressive 'lost' leaders and concentrating on his immediate successors, Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma. The book concludes with an in-depth assessment of new president Cyril Ramaphosa's potential to be a leader for a 'new dawn'. This is an objective and critical work by a close observer who acknowledges the achievement of South African leadership but is acutely aware of the doubts as to the sustainability of South Africa's hard won democratic settlement.

An effective investigation of the context and change in the region calls for a melding of academic approaches, methods and findings with policy oriented needs.  The Israeli Conflict System brings together leading conflict scholars primarily from political science, applying a range of advanced, rigorous analytic and data-gathering techniques to address this single empirical domain—the contemporary Israeli Conflict System. Recognising the causal complexity of this conflict system, the volume’s central theme is that the system’s current conditions are best understood in their broader temporal/historic, cultural/linguistic, and spatial/geographic contexts. Through the lens of economic, geographic, historical, linguistic, and political analyses, and the application of data analysis, experiments, simulations, and models of rational choice, this volume shows how diverse disciplinary perspectives and methodologies can complement each other effectively. In this way, its chapters provide a model for the integration of factors and contexts necessary for understanding contemporary world politics, and a sampling of theories, approaches, and methods that are applicable, useful, or valid under different conditions.

What is the relationship between the demand for particular public policies and a regime’s durability in office in such cases? How does policy-making interact with organizational power, the willingness to resort to coercion and patronage politics in countries home to democratic-looking institutions that none the less fall short of democratic standards?  In this book we show that such regimes do more than just survive and collapse. Moreover, we argue that far from being passive pawns in the hands of their leaders voters in competitive authoritarian regimes, do matter are taken seriously. We investigate how regimes and voters interact in the cases of Georgia and Armenia, two post-Soviet countries in the South Caucasus, to identify how voters preferences feed into policy-making and gauge the extent to which the regimes’ adjustment of their policies crucially affects regime stability. To these ends, we draw on a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods, including a survey experiment carried out in the two countries.

In a comprehensive cross-national study of all non-democratic states from 1946 to 2002 that examines the political uses of these institutions by dictators, Gandhi finds that legislative and partisan institutions are an important component in the operation and survival of authoritarian regimes. She examines how and why these institutions are useful to dictatorships in maintaining power, analyzing the way dictators utilize institutions as a forum in which to organize political concessions to potential opposition in an effort to neutralize threats to their power and to solicit cooperation from groups outside of the ruling elite. The use of legislatures and parties to co-opt opposition results in significant institutional effects on policies and outcomes under dictatorship.","2010-07-26","2022-06-09 06:25:57","2022-06-09 06:25:57","","","258","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oYFPSAAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oYFPSAAACAAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This book argues that, rather than undermining the durability of the Mubarak regime, competitive parliamentary elections ease important forms of distributional conflict, particularly conflict over access to spoils. In a comprehensive examination of the distributive consequences of authoritarian elections in Egypt, Lisa Blaydes examines the triadic relationship between Egypt's ruling regime, the rent-seeking elite that supports the regime, and the ordinary citizens who participate in these elections. She describes why parliamentary candidates finance campaigns to win seats in a legislature that lacks policymaking power, as well as why citizens engage in the costly act of voting in such a context.","2010-11-22","2022-06-09 06:25:33","2022-06-09 06:25:33","","","289","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oQh2XlLH7FgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oQh2XlLH7FgC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ordering Power draws on theoretical insights dating back to Thomas Hobbes to develop a unified framework for explaining both of these political outcomes. States are especially strong and dictatorships especially durable when they have their origins in protection pacts: broad elite coalitions unified by shared support for heightened state power and tightened authoritarian controls as bulwarks against especially threatening and challenging types of contentious politics. These coalitions provide the elite collective action underpinning strong states, robust ruling parties, cohesive militaries, and durable authoritarian regimes all at the same time. Comparative-historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries (Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Vietnam, and Thailand) reveals that subtly divergent patterns of contentious politics after World War II provide the best explanation for the dramatic divergence in Southeast Asia s contemporary states and regimes.","2014-05-14","2022-06-09 06:24:31","2022-06-09 06:24:31","","","344","","","","","Ordering Power","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: VcLQoQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=VcLQoQEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"UVW8ZBD9","book","2015","Lee, Terence","Defect Or Defend: Military Responses to Popular Protests in Authoritarian Asia","","978-1-4214-1516-1","","","","Why do certain militaries brutally suppress popular demonstrations, while others support the path to political liberalization by backing mass social movements?Although social movements and media can help destabilize authoritarian governments, not all social protest is effective or culminates in the toppling of dictatorships. Frequently, the military’s response determines the outcome. In Defect or Defend, Terence Lee uses four case studies from Asia to provide insight into the military’s role during the transitional phase of regime change. Lee compares popular uprisings in the Philippines and Indonesia—both of which successfully engaged military support to bring down authoritarian rule—with protest movements in China and Burma which were violently suppressed by military forces. Lee’s theory of “high personalism” and power-sharing among the armed forces leadership provides a framework for understanding the critical transitory phases of democratization.

This book provides an innovative argument that, rather than being characterised by permanentinsecurity, fear, and arbitrariness, the leadership of dictatorships is actually governed by a series of rules. The rules are identified, and their operation is shown in a range of different types of authoritarian regime. The operation of the rules is explained in ten different countries across fivedifferent regime types: the Soviet Union and China as communist single party regimes; Argentina, Brazil, and Chile as military regimes; electoral authoritarian Malaysia and Mexico; personalist dictatorships in Belarus and Russia; and the Gulf monarchies. Through close analysis of the way leadershipfunctions in these different countries, the book shows how the rules have worked in different institutional settings. It also shows how the power distribution in authoritarian oligarchies is related to the rules. The book transforms our understanding of how authoritarian systems work.","2022-02-12","2022-06-09 06:21:27","2022-06-09 06:21:27","","","401","","","","","Bridling Dictators","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: Nq5JEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Nq5JEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It argues that political outcomes in dictatorships are largely a product of leader-elite relations. Differences in the internal structure of dictatorships affect the dynamics of this relationship. This book shows how dictatorships differ from one another and the implications of these differences for political outcomes. In particular, it examines political processes in personalist, military, single-party, monarchic, and hybrid regimes.The aim of the book is to provide a clear definition of what dictatorship means, how authoritarian politics works, and what the political consequences of dictatorship are. It discusses how authoritarianism influences a range of political outcomes, such as economic performance, international conflict, and leader and regime durability.Numerous case studies from around the world support the theory and research presented to foster a better understanding of the inner workings of authoritarian regimes. By combining theory with concrete political situations, the book will appeal to undergraduate students in comparative politics, international relations, authoritarian politics, and democratization.","2011-02-24","2022-06-09 06:00:30","2022-06-09 06:00:30","","","335","","","","","Dictators and Dictatorships","","","","","A&C Black","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: hOzp3xgL1FwC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=hOzp3xgL1FwC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"74EZ3E3T","book","1999","Fitzpatrick, Sheila","Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s","","978-0-19-505000-4","","","","Here is a pioneering account of everyday life under Stalin, written by one of our foremost authorities on modern Russian history.Focusing on urban areas in the 1930s, Sheila Fitzpatrick shows that with the adoption of collectivization and the first Five-Year Plan, everyday life was utterly transformed. With the abolition of the market, shortages of food, clothing, and all kinds of consumer goods became endemic. As peasants fled the collectivized villages, major cities were soon in the grip of an acute housing crisis, with families jammed for decades in tiny single rooms in communal apartments, counting living space in square meters. It was a world of privation, overcrowding, endless queues, and broken families, in which the regime's promises of future socialist abundance rang hollowly. We read of a government bureaucracy that often turned everyday life into a nightmare, and of the ways that ordinary citizens tried to circumvent it, primarily by patronage and the ubiquitous system of personal connections known as blat. And we read of the police surveillance that was endemic to this society, and the waves of terror like the Great Purges of 1937, that periodically cast this world into turmoil. Fitzpatrick illuminates the ways that Soviet city-dwellers coped with this world, examining such diverse activities as shopping, traveling, telling jokes, finding an apartment, getting an education, landing a job, cultivating patrons and connections, marrying and raising a family, writing complaints and denunciations, voting, and trying to steer clear of the secret police.Based on extensive research in Soviet archives only recently opened to historians, this superb book illuminates the ways ordinary people tried to live normal lives under extraordinary circumstances.","1999-03-04","2022-06-09 05:59:47","2022-06-09 05:59:47","","","312","","","","","Everyday Stalinism","","","","","Oxford University Press, USA","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: QS6IlPQf6owC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=QS6IlPQf6owC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; Music / Genres & Styles / Pop Vocal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Who are the key political actors? Where does the locus of power rest? What determines leadership behavior--and survival? Erica Frantz and Natasha Ezrow argue that dictatorships are not regimes driven by the whims of a single individual. Frantz and Ezrow reveal how leader-elite relations are strongly influenced by the nature of the political institutions in a regime, and in turn how those relations profoundly affect both domestic and foreign policy. Combining cross-national quantitative analyses with a selection of case studies, they uniquely explore the internal architecture of authoritarian government.","2011","2022-06-09 05:58:28","2022-06-09 05:58:28","","","133","","","","","The Politics of Dictatorship","","","","","Lynne Rienner Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: C9m9bwAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=C9m9bwAACAAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, it is increasingly attracting the attentions of historians. Whilst the Cold War has long been a mainstay of political science and contemporary history, recent research approaches postwar Europe in many different ways, all of which are represented in the 35 chapters of this book. As well as diplomatic, political, institutional, economic, and social history, the The Oxford Handbook of Postwar European History contains chapters which approach the past through the lenses of gender, espionage, art and architecture, technology, agriculture, heritage, postcolonialism, memory, and generational change, and shows how the history of postwar Europe can be enriched by looking to disciplines such as anthropology and philosophy. The Handbook covers all of Europe, with a notable focus on Eastern Europe. Including subjects as diverse as the meaning of 'Europe' and European identity, southern Europe after dictatorship, the cultural meanings of the bomb, the 1968 student uprisings, immigration, Americanization, welfare, leisure, decolonization, the Wars of Yugoslav Succession, and coming to terms with the Nazi past, the thirty five essays in this Handbook offer an unparalleled coverage of postwar European history that offers far more than the standard Cold War framework. Readers will find self-contained, state-of-the-art analyses of major subjects, each written by acknowledged experts, as well as stimulating and novel approaches to newer topics. Combining empirical rigour and adventurous conceptual analysis, this Handbook offers in one substantial volume a guide to the numerous ways in which historians are now rewriting the history of postwar Europe.","2012-05-17","2022-06-09 05:57:05","2022-06-09 05:57:05","","","796","","","","","","","","","","OUP Oxford","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: PHD3TsVlqKAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=PHD3TsVlqKAC","","History / Social History; History / Europe / General; History / Europe / Eastern; History / Modern / General; History / Modern / 20th Century / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Niccoló Machiavelli drew on his own experience of office under the turbulent Florentine republic, rejecting traditional values of political theory and recognizing the complicated, transient nature of political life. Concerned not with lofty ideal but with a regime that would last, The Prince has become the bible of realpolitik, and it still retains its power to alarm and to instruct.

They started from a single assertion: Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. They don't care about the ""national interest""-or even their subjects-unless they have to. This clever and accessible book shows that democracy is essentially just a convenient fiction. Governments do not differ in kind but only in the number of essential supporters, or backs that need scratching. The size of this group determines almost everything about politics: what leaders can get away with, and the quality of life or misery under them. The picture the authors paint is not pretty. But it just may be the truth, which is a good starting point for anyone seeking to improve human governance.","2011-09-27","2022-06-09 05:54:26","2022-06-09 05:54:26","","","406","","","","","The Dictator's Handbook","","","","","Hachette UK","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: UBY5DgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=UBY5DgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Fascism & Totalitarianism; Political Science / Commentary & Opinion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"EYUZRYB4","book","2012","Svolik, Milan W.","The Politics of Authoritarian Rule","","978-1-107-02479-3","","","","What drives politics in dictatorships? Milan W. Svolik argues that all authoritarian regimes must resolve two fundamental conflicts. First, dictators face threats from the masses over which they rule - this is the problem of authoritarian control. A second, separate challenge arises from the elites with whom dictators rule - this is the problem of authoritarian power-sharing. Crucially, whether and how dictators resolve these two problems is shaped by the dismal environment in which authoritarian politics takes place: in a dictatorship, no independent authority has the power to enforce agreements among key actors and violence is the ultimate arbiter of conflict. Using the tools of game theory, Svolik explains why some dictators, such as Saddam Hussein, establish personal autocracy and stay in power for decades; why leadership changes elsewhere are regular and institutionalized, as in contemporary China; why some dictatorships are ruled by soldiers, as Uganda was under Idi Amin; why many authoritarian regimes, such as PRI-era Mexico, maintain regime-sanctioned political parties; and why a country's authoritarian past casts a long shadow over its prospects for democracy, as the unfolding events of the Arab Spring reveal. When assessing his arguments, Svolik complements these and other historical case studies with the statistical analysis of comprehensive, original data on institutions, leaders, and ruling coalitions across all dictatorships from 1946 to 2008.","2012-09-17","2022-06-09 05:52:15","2022-06-09 05:52:15","","","253","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: mcZ6pmTnIwQC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=mcZ6pmTnIwQC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The situation is further complicated by internal economic policy changes initiated in mid- 2002. These reforms included marketization of the economy, a large increase in the overall price level, the promotion of special economic zones, and a diplomatic opening to Japan intended to secure the provision of billions of dollars in postcolonial claims.

"5N56IDUN","book","2004","Oh, Kongdan; Hassig, Ralph C.","North Korea through the Looking Glass","","978-0-8157-9820-0","","","","Fifty-five years after its founding at the dawn of the cold war, North Korea remains a land of illusions. Isolated and anachronistic, the country and its culture seem to be dominated exclusively by the official ideology of Juche, which emphasizes national self-reliance, independence, and worship of the supreme leader, General Kim Jong Il. Yet this socialist utopian ideal is pursued with the calculations of international power politics. Kim has transformed North Korea into a militarized state, whose nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and continued threat to South Korea have raised alarm worldwide. This paradoxical combination of cultural isolation and military-first policy has left the North Korean people woefully deprived of the opportunity to advance socially and politically. The socialist economy, guided by political principles and bereft of international support, has collapsed. Thousands, perhaps millions, have died of starvation. Foreign trade has declined and the country's gross domestic product has recorded negative growth every year for a decade. Yet rather than initiate the sort of market reforms that were implemented by other communist governments, North Korean leaders have reverted to the economic policies of the 1950s: mass mobilization, concentration on heavy industry, and increased ideological indoctrination. Although members of the political elite in Pyongyang are acutely aware of their nation's domestic and foreign problems, they are plagued by fear and policy paralysis. North Korea Through the Looking Glass sheds new light on this remote and peculiar country. Drawing on more than ten years of research—including interviews with two dozen North Koreans who made the painful decision to defect from their homeland—Kongdan Oh and Ralph C. Hassig explore what the leadership and the masses believe about their current predicament. Through dual themes of persistence and illusion, they explore North Korea's stubborn adherence to policies that have failed to serve the welfare of the people and, consequently, threaten the future of the regime. Featuring twenty-nine rare and candid photos taken from within the closely guarded country, North Korea Through the Looking Glass illuminates the human society of a country too often mischaracterized for its drab uniformity—not a ""state,"" but a community of twenty million individuals who have, through no fault of their own, fallen on exceedingly hard times.","2004-05-13","2022-06-12 14:45:01","2022-06-12 14:45:01","","","292","","","","","","","","","","Brookings Institution Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: fg15OViIgIEC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=fg15OViIgIEC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Asia / Korea; Political Science / World / Asian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

R.","The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters","","978-1-935554-97-4","","","","Understanding North Korea through its propaganda What do the North Koreans really believe? How do they see themselves and the world around them?Here B.R. Myers, a North Korea analyst and a contributing editor of The Atlantic, presents the first full-length study of the North Korean worldview. Drawing on extensive research into the regime’s domestic propaganda, including films, romance novels and other artifacts of the personality cult, Myers analyzes each of the country’s official myths in turn—from the notion of Koreans’ unique moral purity, to the myth of an America quaking in terror of “the Iron General.” In a concise but groundbreaking historical section, Myers also traces the origins of this official culture back to the Japanese fascist thought in which North Korea’s first ideologues were schooled.What emerges is a regime completely unlike the West’s perception of it. This is neither a bastion of Stalinism nor a Confucian patriarchy, but a paranoid nationalist, “military-first” state on the far right of the ideological spectrum.Since popular support for the North Korean regime now derives almost exclusively from pride in North Korean military might, Pyongyang can neither be cajoled nor bullied into giving up its nuclear program. The implications for US foreign policy—which has hitherto treated North Korea as the last outpost of the Cold War—are as obvious as they are troubling. With North Korea now calling for a “blood reckoning” with the “Yankee jackals,” Myers’s unprecedented analysis could not be more timely.","2011-02-01","2022-06-12 14:39:54","2022-06-12 14:39:54","","","260","","","","","The Cleanest Race","","","","","Melville House","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: KWQEAQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=KWQEAQAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / Korea; Social Science / Discrimination; Political Science / Propaganda","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

America's leading role in the world is no longer assured. Instead, autocrats and populist strongmen are on the rise, and the global order established after 1945 is under attack. This is the phenomenon Katie Stallard tackles in Dancing on Bones, as she examines how the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea manipulate the past to serve the present and secure the future of authoritarian rule. Russia has annexed Crimea, started a war in eastern Ukraine, and repeatedly massed troops on its borders. China has stepped up war games near Taiwan and militarized the South China Sea, while North Korea has resumed missile testing and blood-curdling threats against the United States. These three states consistently top lists of threats to US and European security, and yet the leaders of all three insist that it is their country that is threatened, rewriting history and exploiting the memory of the wars of the last century to justify their actions and shore up popular support. Since coming to power, Xi Jinping has almost doubled the length of China's World War II, Vladimir Putin has elevated the memory of the Great Patriotic War to the status of a national religion, and Kim Jong Un has invested vast sums in rebuilding war museums in his impoverished state, while those who try to challenge the official version of history are silenced and jailed. But this didn't start with Putin, Xi, and Kim, and it won't end with them. Drawing on first-hand, on-the-ground reporting, Dancing on Bones argues that if we want to understand where these three nuclear powers are heading, we must understand the stories they are telling their citizens about the past.","2022-04-08","2022-06-12 14:37:30","2022-06-12 14:37:30","","","305","","","","","Dancing on Bones","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: optlEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=optlEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / World / Russian & Former Soviet Union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mosaddeq became prime minister of Iran in May 1951 and promptly nationalized its British-controlled oil industry, initiating a bitter confrontation between Iraq and Britain that increasingly undermined Mossaddeq's position. He was finally overthrown in August 1953 in a coup d'etat that was organized and led by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. This coup initiated a twenty-five-year period of dictatorship in Iran, leaving many Iranians resentful of the U.S. legacies that still haunt relations between the two countries today.

Exploring this phenomenon, James Jankowski also offers important insights into the political context in which Nasser maneuvered. Jankowski focuses on the period from the 1952 Revolution in Egypt to the dissolution of the short-lived union of Egypt and Syria in 1961 - and on the outlook and actions of Nasser, the dominant figure in Egypt's new revolutionary regime. Concisely and convincingly, he identifies the unique blend of ideological and practical considerations that led Egypt to a progressively deeper involvement in Arab nationalism. He draws on newly available materials from the U.S. and British archives and on the memoir literature now available in Arabic to present a detailed reconstruction of this formative period in Egyptian political history. Jankowski traces Egypt's - and Nasser's - movement from a peripheral to a central position in Arab nationalist politics.","2002","2022-06-12 08:06:05","2022-06-12 08:06:05","","","252","","","","","","","","","","Lynne Rienner Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0yN_dBBIxAwC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0yN_dBBIxAwC","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Social Science / Ethnic Studies / General; History / Africa / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How can wars be prevented? Scholars and policymakers have sought the answers to these questions for centuries. Although wars continue to occur, recent scholarship has made progress toward developing more sophisticated and perhaps more useful theories on the causes and prevention of war. This volume includes essays by leading scholars on contemporary approaches to understanding war and peace. The essays include expositions, analyses, and critiques of some of the more prominent and enduring explanations of war. Several authors discuss realist theories of war, which focus on the distribution of power and the potential for offensive war. Others examine the prominent hypothesis that the spread of democracy will usher in an era of peace. In light of the apparent increase in nationalism and ethnic conflict, several authors present hypotheses on how nationalism causes war and how such wars can be controlled. Contributors also engage in a vigorous debate on whether international institutions can promote peace. In a section on war and peace in the changing international system, several authors consider whether rising levels of international economic independence and environmental scarcity will influence the likelihood of war.","1998-09-15","2022-06-12 08:04:28","2022-06-12 08:04:28","","","610","","","","","","","","","","MIT Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: L7yNxQ4liasC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=L7yNxQ4liasC","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / Peace","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Employing extensive documentation, it offers a fresh approach to long-debated questions such as why Truman refused to recognize the Chinese Communists, why the United States aided Chiang Kai-shek's KMT on Taiwan, why the Korean War escalated into a Sino-American conflict, and why Mao shelled islands in the Taiwan Straits in 1958, thus sparking a major crisis with the United States. Christensen first develops a novel two-level approach that explains why leaders manipulate low-level conflicts to mobilize popular support for expensive, long-term security strategies. By linking ""grand strategy,"" domestic politics, and the manipulation of ideology and conflict, Christensen provides a nuanced and sophisticated link between domestic politics and foreign policy. He then applies the approach to Truman's policy toward the Chinese Communists in 1947-50 and to Mao's initiation of the 1958 Taiwan Straits Crisis. In these cases the extension of short-term conflict was useful in gaining popular support for the overall grand strategy that each leader was promoting domestically: Truman's limited-containment strategy toward the USSR and Mao's self-strengthening programs during the Great Leap Forward. Christensen also explores how such low-level conflicts can escalate, as they did in Korea, despite leaders' desire to avoid actual warfare.","2020-05-05","2022-06-12 08:02:46","2022-06-12 08:02:46","","","336","","","","","Useful Adversaries","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: fOfaDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=fOfaDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LC2YBYK4","book","1993","Graubard, Stephen Richards","Exit from Communism","","978-1-4128-2318-0","","","","Since 1989, it has been possible to review what has been published both at home and abroad on the communist states of Central and Eastern Europe and, no less importantly, on the Soviet Union itself, from a new perspective. Few have chosen to engage in this Herculean task, whether out of a residual civility in not wishing to mock certain aging scholars whose research would appear curiously dated, or out of a sense of fatigue with the whole subject of casting aspersions on mistaken views.  A New Europe for the Old? asks whether the master narratives that circulated so widely in the West in the half-century since 1945 remain valid. Stephen Graubard&#39;s volume raises pertinent questions regarding the current state of the European world as it has evolved since 1989. He includes contributions from important scholars around the world: &quot;A New Europe for the Old?&quot; by Martin Malia; &quot;The Serbs: The Sweet and Rotten Smell of History&quot; by Tim Judah; &quot;Illyrianism and the Croatian Quest for Statehood&quot; by Marcus Tanner; &quot;To Be or Not to Be Balkan: Romania&#39;s Quest for Self-Definition&quot; by Tom Gallagher; &quot;Ukraine: From an Imperial Periphery to Sovereign State&quot; by Roman Szporlunk; &quot;Ethnic Nationalism in the Russian Federation&quot; by Anatoly M.

Culture, Geertz argues, does not drive human behavior. Rather, it is a web of symbols that can help us better understand what that behavior means. A thick description explains not only the behavior, but the context in which it occurs, and to describe something thickly, Geertz argues, is the fundamental role of the anthropologist.Named one of the 100 most important books published since World War II by the Times Literary Supplement, The Interpretation of Cultures transformed how we think about others' cultures and our own.

Environmental, human security, globalization, and cyberspace topics are fully developed as well. Vignettes of seventy-eight key cities give the reader a vivid understanding of daily life and the ""spirit of place."" An introductory chapter presents an overview of key terms and concepts, and a concluding chapter projects the world's urban future. Liberally illustrated with a new selection of photographs, maps, and diagrams, the text also includes a rich array of textboxes to highlight key topics ranging from gender and the city to Islamic fashion and global warming. Bibliographic sources, websites, and an appendix of UN data provide additional resources for helping students understand more about the urban world. Clearly written and timely, Cities of the World will be invaluable for those teaching introductory or advanced classes on global cities, regional geography, and urban studies.

Placing this formerly insular society in a global context, Michael J. Seth describes how this ancient, culturally and ethnically homogeneous society first fell victim to Japanese imperialist expansionism, and then was arbitrarily divided in half after World War II. Seth traces the postwar paths of the two Koreas—with different political and social systems and different geopolitical orientations—as they evolved into sharply contrasting societies. South Korea, after an unpromising start, became one of the few postcolonial developing states to enter the ranks of the first world, with a globally competitive economy, a democratic political system, and a cosmopolitan and dynamic culture. By contrast, North Korea became one of the world's most totalitarian and isolated societies, a nuclear power with an impoverished and famine-stricken population. Considering the radically different and historically unprecedented trajectories of the two Koreas, Seth assesses the insights they offer for understanding not only modern Korea but the broader perspective of world history. All readers looking for a balanced, knowledgeable history will be richly rewarded with this clear and cogent book.","2016-03-03","2022-06-12 07:56:38","2022-06-12 07:56:38","","","355","","","","","A Concise History of Modern Korea","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: nf3TCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=nf3TCwAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / Korea; Social Science / Regional Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, Tunisia is now seen as the unlikely birth place and exemplar of the process of democratisation long overdue in the Arab world. Mixing political, historical, economic, social and cultural analyses and approaches, these essays reflect on the local, regional and transnational dynamics together with the long and short term factors that, when combined, set in motion the Tunisian revolution and the Arab uprisings. Above all, the book maps the intertwined genealogies of cultural dissent that have contributed to the mobilisation of protesters and to the sustenance of protests between 17 December 2010 and 14 January 2011, and beyond.","2013-09-07","2022-06-12 07:56:07","2022-06-12 07:56:07","","","353","","","","","Making of the Tunisian Revolution","","","","","Edinburgh University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: QlarBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=QlarBgAAQBAJ","","History / Africa / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Is there a choice between democracy and stability? Can democracy be promoted from outside or should we focus on the promotion of democratic culture from within a country? Are different cultures equally compatible with democratic systems of government? Finally, should the promotion of democracy be seen as part of regular development cooperation and what are the respective roles of national governments, international organizations and civil society?The highly experienced contributors to this volume suggest there is a positive relationship between the two: more democracy implies more openness and checks and balances, and more accountability and less corruption all of which is conducive to sustainable development.The book is based on a series of lectures organized by the Society of International Development (SID), the Netherlands.Contributors include William Easterley (New York University and Brookings Institution, author of White Men s Burden), Michael Edwards (Ford Foundation), Thomas Carothers (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace), Paul Collier, David, Kumi Naidoo (the World Alliance for Citizen Participation), Nico Schrijver, Kim Campbell (former Prime Minister of Canada and co-founder of the Club de Madrid) and others.""","2008","2022-06-12 07:53:52","2022-06-12 07:53:52","","","308","","","","","","","","","","KIT Publishers","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: nMQUAQAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=nMQUAQAAIAAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Social Science / Developing & Emerging Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"6UQAXZPI","book","2020","Taspinar, Ömer","What the West is Getting Wrong about the Middle East: Why Islam is Not the Problem","","978-0-7556-0715-0","","","","The West's actions in the Middle East are based on a fundamental misunderstanding: political Islam is repeatedly assumed to be the main cause of conflict and unrest in the region. The idea that we can decipher Jihadist radicalization or problems in the Middle East simply by reading the Qur'an has now become symptomatic of our age. This dangerous over-simplification and the West's obsession with Islam dominates media and policy analysis, ultimately skewing intervention and preventing long-term solutions and stability in the region. Ömer Taspinar, who has 20 years' research and policymaking experience, explains here what is really going on in the Middle East. The book is based on three of the most pressing cases currently under the spotlight: the role of Erdogan and the unrest in Turkey; the sectarian clashes in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon; and the existence of the so-called Islamic State. Islam is often seen as the root cause of the challenge associated with these cases. But by unpacking the real issues, such as entrenched authoritarianism, vast energy resources, excessive defense spending, and the youth bulge, the book demystifies what is happening and cites governance and nationalism as the main drivers of conflict. The book shows the importance of treating the causes – which are economic, social and institutional – rather than the symptom – the continued and growing success of Islamist parties and jihadist movements in assessing the Middle East. In revealing exactly how Islamism is activated and by analyzing the structural challenges of the region, this unique insider's account provides a map to understanding Middle Eastern wars and conflicts and the prospects for the future.","2020-09-17","2022-06-12 07:52:42","2022-06-12 07:52:42","","","281","","","","","What the West is Getting Wrong about the Middle East","","","","","Bloomsbury Publishing","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: m1_xDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=m1_xDwAAQBAJ","","History / Middle East / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Nationalism & Patriotism; Political Science / International Relations / Diplomacy; Political Science / Geopolitics; Religion / Islam / General; Social Science / Islamic Studies; Social Science / Minority Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gause illuminates the foreign policy tightrope these states walk in the Middle East: self-defense is problematic, regional pressures translate directly into the domestic arena, and relations with the United States cause as well as solve many problems. Gause examines the interplay of Islamic fundamentalism, tribalism, and, most importantly, oil wealth that has determined the power structure of the Gulf monarchies.

"DUPTF3Q8","book","2013","Levene, Mark","Annihilation: Volume II: The European Rimlands 1939-1953","","978-0-19-250956-7","","","","From the years leading up to the First World War to the aftermath of the Second, Europe experienced an era of genocide. As well as the Holocaust, this period also witnessed the Armenian genocide in 1915, mass killings in Bolshevik and Stalinist Russia, and a host of further ethnic cleansings in Anatolia, the Balkans, and Eastern Europe. Crisis of Genocide seeks to integrate these genocidal events into a single, coherent history. Over two volumes, Mark Levene demonstrates how the relationship between geography, nation, and power came to play a key role in the emergence of genocide in a collapsed or collapsing European imperial zone - the Rimlands - and how the continuing geopolitical contest for control of these Eastern European or near-European regions destabilised relationships between diverse and multifaceted ethnic communities who traditionally had lived side by side. An emergent pattern of toxicity can also be seen in the struggles for regional dominance as pursued by post-imperial states, nation-states, and would-be states. Volume II: Annihilation covers the period from 1939 to 1953, particularly focussing on the Second World War, and its aftermath, the Holocaust and its lasting impact, and the latter part of the Stalinist regime. Levene demonstrates that while the attempted Nazi mass murder of the entirety of European Jewry represents the most thoroughgoing and extreme consequence of efforts aimed at political and social reformulation of the Rimlands' arena in particular, the accumulation and concentration of genocidal violence against many 'minority' groups would suggest that anti-Semitism or racism alone is insufficient to provide a comprehensive explanation for genocide.","2013-12-19","2022-06-12 07:49:20","2022-06-12 07:49:20","","","668","","","","","Annihilation","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: wr9EDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=wr9EDwAAQBAJ","","History / Europe / General; History / Modern / 20th Century; Political Science / Genocide & War Crimes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But Moore is not ultimately concerned with explaining economic development so much as exploring why modes of development produced different political forms that managed the transition to industrialism and modernization. Why did one society modernize into a ""relatively free,"" democratic society (by which Moore means England)? Why did others metamorphose into fascist or communist states? His core thesis is that in each country, the relationship between the landlord class and the peasants was a primary influence on the ultimate form of government the society arrived at upon arrival in its modern age. “Throughout the book, there is the constant play of a mind that is scholarly, original, and imbued with the rarest gift of all, a deep sense of human reality . . .

Extensive primary data is used to analyze the impact of the collective actions and ideologies of the major social groups involved - students, clergy, workers, and capitalists - and how they affected the potential for a successful revolutionary outcome.

Social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the outcomes of such revolutions. It develops a rigorous, comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the 1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, Skocpol urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to explanations of revolutions.","2015-09-29","2022-06-12 07:43:31","2022-06-12 07:43:31","","","578","","","","","States and Social Revolutions","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 83GgCgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=83GgCgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / History & Theory; Political Science / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this audacious book about leadership and historical choices, Richard J. Samuels emphasizes the role of human ingenuity in political change. He draws on interviews and archival research in a fascinating series of paired biographies of political and business leaders from Italy and Japan. Beginning with the founding of modern nation-states after the Meiji Restoration and the Risorgimento, Samuels traces the developmental dynamic in both countries through the failure of early liberalism, the coming of fascism, imperial adventures, defeat in wartime, and reconstruction as American allies. Highlights of Machiavelli's Children include new accounts of the making of postwar Japanese politics—using American money and Manchukuo connections—and of the collapse of Italian political parties in the Clean Hands (Mani Pulite) scandal.The author also tells the more recent stories of Umberto Bossi's regional experiment, the Lega Nord, the different choices made by Italian and Japanese communist party leaders after the collapse of the USSR, and the leadership of Silvio Berlusconi and Ishihara Shintar on the contemporary right in each country.","2003","2022-06-12 07:40:55","2022-06-12 07:40:55","","","492","","","","","Machiavelli's Children","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RNv1YCA3IDkC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=RNv1YCA3IDkC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Asia / Japan; History / Europe / Italy; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"JWBT8A2L","book","2007","Berman, Ilan","Tehran Rising: Iran's Challenge to the United States","","978-0-7425-4905-0","","","","The Islamic Republic of Iran today constitutes the single greatest challenge to the United States and the War on Terror. In the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, Iranian policymakers are busy cobbling together alliances intended to elevate it to the status of a regional superpower at the expense of the U.S. and its European allies. In Iraq, Iran is spending millions to perpetuate a lingering insurgency that threatens to transform the former Ba'athist state into another Islamic Republic. Iran remains the world's most active sponsor of terrorism, fueling the activities of Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah and al-Qaeda. And through its nuclear advances, mature chemical- and biological weapons programs, and an expanding conventional military, Iran is gaining the capability to catastrophically alter the balance of power far beyond its immediate neighborhood. All of this has been guided by an ambitious strategic agenda that is designed to make the Iranian regime the center of gravity in the post-Saddam Middle East. As evidence of this threat mounts, one thing remains crystal clear to Ilan Berman: 'Washington is woefully unprepared to deal with this mounting peril.' Berman's approach is hard-hitting, provocative and unflinchingly critical. But he takes the exploration of Iran's menace one step further, providing what has been missing so far in the foreign policy discourse regarding Iran, both within the U.S. government and outside it_practical policy prescriptions designed to contain Iran's strategic ambitions.","2007","2022-06-12 07:39:45","2022-06-12 07:39:45","","","246","","","","","Tehran Rising","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: ihhZ8K0dawwC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=ihhZ8K0dawwC","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"F7GJDJVM","book","2009","Harrison, Selig S.","Korean Endgame: A Strategy for Reunification and U.S. Disengagement","","978-1-4008-2491-5","","","","Nearly half a century after the fighting stopped, the 1953 Armistice has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War. While Russia and China withdrew the last of their forces in 1958, the United States maintains 37,000 troops in South Korea and is pledged to defend it with nuclear weapons. In Korean Endgame, Selig Harrison mounts the first authoritative challenge to this long-standing U.S. policy. Harrison shows why North Korea is not--as many policymakers expect--about to collapse. And he explains why existing U.S. policies hamper North-South reconciliation and reunification. Assessing North Korean capabilities and the motivations that have led to its forward deployments, he spells out the arms control concessions by North Korea, South Korea, and the United States necessary to ease the dangers of confrontation, centering on reciprocal U.S. force redeployments and U.S. withdrawals in return for North Korean pullbacks from the thirty-eighth parallel. Similarly, he proposes specific trade-offs to forestall the North's development of nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems, calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear umbrella in conjunction with agreements to denuclearize Korea embracing China, Russia, and Japan. The long-term goal of U.S. policy, he argues, should be the full disengagement of U.S. combat forces from Korea as part of regional agreements insulating the peninsula from all foreign conventional and nuclear forces. A veteran journalist with decades of extensive firsthand knowledge of North Korea and long-standing contacts with leaders in Washington, Seoul, and Pyongyang, Harrison is perfectly placed to make these arguments. Throughout, he supports his analysis with revealing accounts of conversations with North Korean, South Korean, and U.S. leaders over thirty-five years. Combining probing scholarship with a seasoned reporter's on-the-ground experience and insights, he has given us the definitive book on U.S. policy in Korea--past, present, and future.","2009-02-10","2022-06-12 07:39:16","2022-06-12 07:39:16","","","440","","","","","Korean Endgame","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: csVMXWKo734C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=csVMXWKo734C","","Political Science / International Relations / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the Clinton White House prepared to bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities, private citizen Jimmy Carter mediated to avert war and set the stage for a deal freezing North Korea's plutonium production. The 1994 Agreed Framework collapsed after eight years, but when Pyongyang went critical, the negotiations got serious. Each time the parties advanced one or two steps, however, their advance seemed to spawn one or two steps backward.

They argue that placing the nexus between geopolitics and development at the centre of the analysis helps explain the country's rapid catch-up industrialisation, its subsequent secular decline followed by collapse in the 1990s, and why the reform process has been markedly more conservative compared to other state socialist societies. As such, they draw attention to the specificities of North Korea's experience of late development, but also place it in a broader comparative context by understanding the country not solely through the analytical lens of state socialism but also as an instance of post-colonial national development.","2021-04-15","2022-06-12 03:57:54","2022-06-12 03:57:54","","","303","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JDMiEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=JDMiEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Public Policy / General; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Political Science / World / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Now the CIA says it possesses nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, as well as long-range missiles capable of delivering them to America's West Coast. But, as Bruce Cumings demonstrates in this provocative, lively read, the story of the U.S.-Korea conflict is more complex than American leaders or news media would have us believe. Drawing on his extensive knowledge of Korea, and on declassified government reports, Cumings traces that story, from the brutal Korean War to the present crisis. Harboring no illusions regarding the totalitarian Kim Jong II regime, Cumings nonetheless insists on a more nuanced approach. The result is both a counter-narrative to the official U.S. - and North Korean - version and a fascinating portrayal of North Korea; a country that suffers through foreign invasions, natural disasters, and its own internal contradictions, yet somehow continues to survive.","2004","2022-06-12 03:56:42","2022-06-12 03:56:42","","","241","","","","","North Korea","","","","","Scribe","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: c2nZAAAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=c2nZAAAACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"K5RRAEIU","book","2010","Acemoglu, Daron","A Theory of Military Dictatorships","","","","","","We investigate how nondemocratic regimes use the military and how this can lead to the emergence of military dictatorships. Nondemocratic regimes need the use of force in order to remain in power, but this creates a political moral hazard problem; a strong military may not simply work as an agent of the elite but may turn against them in order to create a regime more in line with their own objectives. The political moral hazard problem increases the cost of using repression in nondemocratic regimes and in particular, necessitates high wages and policy concessions to the military. When these concessions are not sufficient, the military can take action against a nondemocratic regime in order to create its own dictatorship. A more important consequence of the presence of a strong military is that once transition to democracy takes place, the military poses a coup threat against the nascent democratic regime until it is reformed. The anticipation that the military will be reformed in the future acts as an additional motivation for the military to undertake coups against democratic governments. We show that greater inequality makes the use of the military in nondemocratic regimes more likely and also makes it more difficult for democracies to prevent military coups. In addition, greater inequality also makes it more likely that nondemocratic regimes are unable to solve the political moral hazard problem and thus creates another channel for the emergence of military dictatorships. We also show that greater natural resource rents make military coups against democracies more likely, but have ambiguous effects on the political equilibrium in nondemocracies (because with abundant natural resources, repression becomes more valuable to the elite, but also more expensive to maintain because of the more severe political moral hazard that natural resources induce). Finally, we discuss how the national defense role of the military interacts with its involvement in domestic politics.","2010","2022-06-13 14:07:37","2022-06-13 14:07:37","","","63","","","","","","","","","","SSRN","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: pBHszgEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=pBHszgEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arendt explores the institutions and operations of totalitarian movements, focusing on the two genuine forms of totalitarian government in our time—Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia—which she adroitly recognizes were two sides of the same coin, rather than opposing philosophies of Right and Left. From this vantage point, she discusses the evolution of classes into masses, the role of propaganda in dealing with the nontotalitarian world, the use of terror, and the nature of isolation and loneliness as preconditions for total domination.","1973-03-21","2022-06-13 14:07:16","2022-06-13 14:07:16","","","579","","","","","","","","","","HarperCollins","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: zLrKGGxBKjAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=zLrKGGxBKjAC","","Political Science / History & Theory; History / Europe / General; Political Science / Essays","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Charles K. Armstrong contends that a major source of North Korea's strength and resiliency, as well as of its flaws and shortcomings, lies in the poorly understood origins of its system of government. He examines the genesis of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) both as an important yet rarely studied example of a communist state and as part of modern Korean history. North Korea is one of the last redoubts of ""unreformed"" Marxism-Leninism in the world. Yet it is not a Soviet satellite in the East European manner, nor is its government the result of a local revolution, as in Cuba and Vietnam. Instead, the DPRK represents a unique ""indigenization"" of Soviet Stalinism, Armstrong finds. The system that formed under the umbrella of the Soviet occupation quickly developed into a nationalist regime as programs initiated from above merged with distinctive local conditions.Armstrong's account is based on long-classified documents captured by U.S. forces during the Korean War. This enormous archive of over 1.6 million pages provides unprecedented insight into the making of the Pyongyang regime and fuels the author's argument that the North Korean state is likely to remain viable for some years to come.","2013-05-15","2022-06-13 14:06:51","2022-06-13 14:06:51","","","288","","","","","","","","","","Cornell University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=eUf-_XACg3UC","","History / Asia / Korea; History / Asia / General; History / Military / Revolutions & Wars of Independence; History / Wars & Conflicts / Korean War","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The volume conceptualizes the communist universe as consisting of the ten regimes in Eastern Europe and Mongolia that eventually collapsed in 1989–91, and the five regimes that survived the fall of the Berlin Wall: China, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea and Cuba. The essays offer a theoretical argument that emphasizes the importance of institutional adaptations as a foundation of communist resilience. In particular, the contributors focus on four adaptations: of the economy, of ideology, of the mechanisms for inclusion of potential rivals, and of the institutions of vertical and horizontal accountability. The volume argues that when regimes are no longer able to implement adaptive change, contingent leadership choices and contagion dynamics make collapse more likely.","2013-07-31","2022-06-13 14:06:06","2022-06-13 14:06:06","","","498","","","","","Why Communism Did Not Collapse","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: C_A0AgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=C_A0AgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important to know how the likelihood of environment in which post-conflict reconstruction efforts will be implemented. The viability of any contingency plan should be assessed, based on an assumption about the environment being in probable upheaval. However, little analysis of the viability of the contingency plan, including the DDR program, has been undertaken in the context of North Korean regime collapse. Especially, the research about expectations and assumptions related to the possible North Korean attitude and probable post-regime collapse environment has been rare. The contingency planning, thus, needs further research and empirical supporting data, which can enhance its viability in practice. Given this perspective, this study attempts to predict the North Korean people's possible attitude in their upheaval, based on analysis about the current regime's control system and recent changes. This study also assumes different scenarios in which DDR would be implemented to reconstruct a post-conflict society, by differentiating critical uncertainties in each case.CHAPTER I - INTRODUCTION * A.

When Hainan became a province in 1988, the central government wanted to make it a special zone that would go far beyond even the other (SEZs in system reform. It was to have a small government and large society, implying very little state-operated enterprise and minimal government. Despite its essential backwardness, pockets of absolute poverty, inadequate infrastructure and other difficulties, Hainan has made progress in economic development, attracting investment from both the mainland and overseas. Its economy, previously dominated by state-owned rubber and iron ore industries, has diversified through substantial growth in services and small-scale enterprise, including export-oriented joint ventures. However, the pace of reform and investment slowed during the national austerity program from early 1989 to late 1991, calling into question the ambitiousness of some of Hainan's plans to lead the way in reform experiments in agriculture, industry and human resource development. Recently, though, the reform agenda seems to have regained momentum, as Hainan deals in greater depth with the trade, investment and fiscal modernization that could propel it into prosperity. This study also suggests ways in which the province's reform agenda might be accelerated as the next key steps are identified and opportunities seized by both Beijing and Haikou.","1992","2022-06-13 13:54:36","2022-06-13 13:54:36","","","80","","","","","A Chinese Province as a Reform Experiment","","","","","World Bank","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: aP6RAAAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=aP6RAAAAIAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

North Korea under Kim Jong Il examines how internal changes in North Korea since the early 1970s have structured that nation’s apparently provocative nuclear diplomacy and recent economic reform measures. To understand these changes, author Sung Chull Kim uncovers relatively unknown internal aspects of the country under Kim Jong Il’s leadership. His account, based on a thorough examination of primary sources, traces the origins, consolidation, and dissonance of North Korea’s systemic identity. He reveals how official and unofficial developments in the domains of North Korea’s politics, ideology, economics, and intellectual-cultural affairs have brought about system-wide duality, particularly between socialist principles embedded in the official ideology and economic institutions.Sung Chull Kim is Associate Professor of Northeast Asian Studies at the Hiroshima Peace Institute in Japan.","2012-02-16","2022-06-13 13:53:46","2022-06-13 13:53:46","","","297","","","","","North Korea under Kim Jong Il","","","","","SUNY Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.fr/books?id=P3u7A04Cn-MC","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Asia / Korea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ALBSNA63","book","2020","Mauk, Marlene","Citizen Support for Democratic and Autocratic Regimes","","978-0-19-259713-7","","","","Citizen Support for Democratic and Autocratic Regimes takes a political-culture perspective on the struggle between democracy and autocracy by examining how these regimes fare in the eyes of their citizens. Taking a globally comparative approach, it studies both the levels as well as the individual- and system-level sources of political support in democracies and autocracies worldwide. The book develops an explanatory model of regime support which includes both individual- and system level determinants and specifies not only the general causal mechanisms and pathways through which these determinants affect regime support but also spells out how these effects might vary between the two types of regimes. It empirically tests its propositions using multi-level structural equation modeling and a comprehensive dataset that combines recent public-opinion data from six cross-national survey projects with aggregate data from various sources for more than 100 democracies and autocracies. It finds that both the levels and individual-level sources of regime support are the same in democracies and autocracies, but that the way in which system-level context factors affect regime support differs between the two types of regimes. The results enhance our understanding of what determines citizen support for fundamentally different regimes, help assessing the present and future stability of democracies and autocracies, and provide clear policy implications to those interested in strengthening support for democracy and/or fostering democratic change in autocracies.

Featuring interviews with more than thirty North Koreans who defected to Seoul and Tokyo, the book explores the subjective experience of the nation's famine and its citizens' social and psychological strategies for coping with the regime.These oral testimonies show how ordinary North Koreans, from farmers and soldiers to students and diplomats, framed the mounting struggles and deaths surrounding them as the famine progressed. Following the development of the disaster, North Koreans deployed complex discursive strategies to rationalize the horror and hardship in their lives, practices that maintained citizens' loyalty to the regime during the famine and continue to sustain its rule today. Casting North Koreans as a diverse people with a vast capacity for adaptation rather than as a monolithic entity passively enduring oppression, Marching Through Suffering positions personal history as key to the interpretation of political violence.","2015-04-21","2022-06-13 13:51:17","2022-06-13 13:51:17","","","267","","","","","Marching Through Suffering","","","","","Columbia University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0IAyBgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0IAyBgAAQBAJ","","History / Asia / Korea; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Human Rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"9MYJJFZA","book","2012","Chanlett-Avery, Emma; Service, Congressional","North Korea: U.S. Relations, Nuclear Diplomacy, and Internal Situation","","978-1-4781-1329-4","","","","North Korea has been among the most vexing and persistent problems in U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War period. The United States has never had formal diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the official name for North Korea). Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program have consumed the past three U.S. administrations, even as some analysts anticipated a collapse of the isolated authoritarian regime. North Korea has been the recipient of well over $1 billion in U.S. aid and the target of dozens of U.S. sanctions. This report provides background information on the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program that began in the early 1990s under the Clinton Administration. As U.S. policy toward Pyongyang evolved through the George W. Bush presidency and into the Obama Administration, the negotiations moved from mostly bilateral to the multilateral Six-Party Talks (made up of China, Japan, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, and the United States). Although the negotiations have reached some key agreements that lay out deals for aid and recognition to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization, major problems with implementation have persisted. With talks suspended since 2009, concern about proliferation to other actors has grown. After Kim Jong-il's sudden death in December 2011, the reclusive regime now faces the challenge of transferring dynastic power to his youngest son, Kim Jong-un. Pyongyang had shown signs of reaching out in 2011 after a string of provocative acts in 2010, including an alleged torpedo attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 South Korean servicemen and an artillery attack on Yeonpyeong Island that killed two South Korean Marines and two civilians. When Kim passed, the United States was reportedly on the verge of announcing an agreement on food aid and Pyongyang had indicated a willingness to freeze some parts of its nuclear program. The Obama Administration, like its predecessors, faces fundamental decisions on how to approach North Korea. To what degree should the United States attempt to isolate the regime diplomatically and financially? Should those efforts be balanced with engagement initiatives that continue to push for steps toward denuclearization, or for better human rights behavior? Should the United States adjust its approach in the post-Kim Jong-il era? Is China a reliable partner in efforts to pressure Pyongyang? Have the North's nuclear tests and alleged torpedo attack demonstrated that regime change is the only way to peaceful resolution? How should the United States consider its alliance relationships with Japan and South Korea as it formulates its North Korea policy? Should the United States continue to offer humanitarian aid?

In a comprehensive cross-national study of all non-democratic states from 1946 to 2002 that examines the political uses of these institutions by dictators, Gandhi finds that legislative and partisan institutions are an important component in the operation and survival of authoritarian regimes. She examines how and why these institutions are useful to dictatorships in maintaining power, analyzing the way dictators utilize institutions as a forum in which to organize political concessions to potential opposition in an effort to neutralize threats to their power and to solicit cooperation from groups outside of the ruling elite. The use of legislatures and parties to co-opt opposition results in significant institutional effects on policies and outcomes under dictatorship.","2010-07-26","2022-06-13 13:50:08","2022-06-13 13:50:08","","","258","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: oYFPSAAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=oYFPSAAACAAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is often less-tangible political and economic variables, rather than raw military power, that ultimately determine national will to fight. In this analysis, the authors explore how these variables strengthen or weaken a government's determination to conduct sustained military operations, even when the expectation of success decreases or the need for significant political, economic, and military sacrifices increases. This report is part of a broader RAND Arroyo Center effort to help U.S. leaders better understand and influence will to fight at both the national level and the tactical and operational levels. It presents findings and recommendations based on a wide-ranging literature review, a series of interviews, 15 case studies (including deep dives into conflicts involving the Korean Peninsula and Russia), and reviews of relevant modeling and war-gaming. The authors propose an exploratory model of 15 variables that can be tailored and applied to a wide set of conflict scenarios and drive a much-needed dialogue among analysts conducting threat assessments, contingency plans, war games, and other efforts that require an evaluation of how future conflicts might unfold.

The incumbent leadership group is replaced by democratically elected leaders. Someone from the incumbent leadership group replaces him, and the regime persists. Or the incumbent leadership group loses control to a different group that replaces it with a new autocracy. Much scholarship exists on the first kind of transition, but little on transitions from one autocracy to another, though they make up about half of all regime changes. We introduce a new data set that facilitates the investigation of all three kinds of transition. It provides transition information for the 280 autocratic regimes in existence from 1946 to 2010. The data identify how regimes exit power, how much violence occurs during transitions, and whether the regimes that precede and succeed them are autocratic. We explain the data set and show how it differs from currently available data. The new data identify autocratic regime breakdowns regardless of whether the country democratizes, which makes possible the investigation of why the ouster of dictators sometimes leads to democracy but often does not, and many other questions. We present a number of examples to highlight how the new data can be used to explore questions about why dictators start wars and why autocratic breakdown sometimes results in the establishment of a new autocratic regime rather than democratization.

This article presents a theoretical framework that seeks to explain the longevity of autocracies by referring to three pillars of stability: legitimation, repression, and co-optation. These three causal factors are derived by distilling and synthesizing the main arguments of classic and more recent research efforts. Particular emphasis is paid to re-incorporate legitimation in the explanation of stable autocracies. The article conceptionalizes the three pillars and discusses methods of concrete measurement. It then moves on to explain the stabilization process. How do these pillars develop their stabilizing effect? It is argued that reinforcement processes take place both within and between the pillars. They take the form of exogenous reinforcement, self-reinforcement, and reciprocal reinforcement. To illustrate the inner logic of these processes, I draw on empirical examples. I also state what we would need to observe empirically and how we can approach the three pillars methodically. A theoretical framework of this nature has two advantages: it is able to take the complexity of autocratic regimes into account while remaining parsimonious enough to be applicable to all autocratic regimes, irrespective of their subtype; and it integrates a static view to explain stability, with the emphasis on the underlying stabilization mechanisms and facilitates within-case and cross-case comparisons.","2013-01-01","2022-06-13 13:45:55","2022-06-13 13:45:55","2022-06-13 13:45:55","13-38","","1","20","","","The three pillars of stability","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13510347.2013.738860","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\W8SJPSZZ\Gerschewski - 2013 - The three pillars of stability legitimation, repr.pdf; C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\GYRDBHW8\13510347.2013.html","","","autocracy; legitimation; co-optation; repression; stability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, despite long-term sanction pressure by the European Union, the United States and/or the United Nations, non-democratic rule has proven to be extremely persistent. Which domestic and international factors account for the regimes' ability to resist external pressure? Based on a new global dataset on sanctions from 1990 to 2011, the results of a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) provide new insights for the research on sanctions and on authoritarian regimes. Most significantly, sanctions strengthen authoritarian rule if the regime manages to incorporate their existence into its legitimation strategy. Such an unintended ‘rally-round-the-flag’ effect occurs where sanctions are imposed on regimes that possess strong claims to legitimacy and have only limited economic and societal linkages to the sender of sanctions.","2014","2022-06-13 13:44:52","2022-06-13 13:44:52","2022-06-13 13:44:52","635-653","","4","53","","","Claims to legitimacy count","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1475-6765.12065","","C:\Users\j.reidhead\Zotero\storage\ZHWYFL9W\1475-6765.html","","","authoritarian regimes; claims to legitimacy; democratisation; fsQCA; sanctions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors present an evidence-based portrait of key features of the authoritarian landscape with newly collected data about 200 dictatorial regimes. They examine the central political processes that shape the policy choices of dictatorships and how they compel reaction from policy makers in the rest of the world. Importantly, this book explains how some dictators concentrate great power in their own hands at the expense of other members of the dictatorial elite. Dictators who can monopolize decision making in their countries cause much of the erratic, warlike behavior that disturbs the rest of the world. By providing a picture of the central processes common to dictatorships, this book puts the experience of specific countries in perspective, leading to an informed understanding of events and the likely outcome of foreign responses to autocracies.","2018-08-23","2022-06-13 13:44:20","2022-06-13 13:44:20","","","275","","","","","How Dictatorships Work","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: qnlnDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=qnlnDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Fascism & Totalitarianism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This analysis of post-communist state reconstruction provides surprising answers to this fundamental question of party politics. Across the post-communist democracies, governing parties have opportunistically reconstructed the state - simultaneously exploiting it by extracting state resources and building new institutions that further such extraction. They enfeebled or delayed formal state institutions of monitoring and oversight, established new discretionary structures of state administration, and extracted enormous informal profits from the privatization of the communist economy. By examining how post-communist political parties rebuilt the state in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia, Grzymala-Busse explains how even opportunistic political parties will limit their corrupt behaviour and abuse of state resources when faced with strong political competition.","2007-04-09","2022-06-13 13:44:06","2022-06-13 13:44:06","","","7","","","","","Rebuilding Leviathan","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: DMNYLmCaQ3UC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=DMNYLmCaQ3UC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy; Political Science / Public Affairs & Administration; History / Europe / General; Political Science / Political Process / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When, and how, do they use repression to do so? Dictators and their Secret Police explores the role of the coercive apparatus under authoritarian rule in Asia - how these secret organizations originated, how they operated, and how their violence affected ordinary citizens. Greitens argues that autocrats face a coercive dilemma: whether to create internal security forces designed to manage popular mobilization, or defend against potential coup. Violence against civilians, she suggests, is a byproduct of their attempt to resolve this dilemma. Drawing on a wealth of new historical evidence, this book challenges conventional wisdom on dictatorship: what autocrats are threatened by, how they respond, and how this affects the lives and security of the millions under their rule. It offers an unprecedented view into the use of surveillance, coercion, and violence, and sheds new light on the institutional and social foundations of authoritarian power.","2016-08-16","2022-06-13 13:43:58","2022-06-13 13:43:58","","","347","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=GR-nDAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Fascism & Totalitarianism; Social Science / Violence in Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Assessing the competition between the North and South Korean economies from partition to the end of the Soviet era, Nicholas Eberstadt argues that the storyline is not quite as simple as the now-prevailing narrative suggests (that centrally-planned economies are doomed to fail against market-oriented alternatives). Rather, he suggests, the race for material progress was just that: a race, the results of which were far from preordained at the outset. In Policy and Economic Performance in Divided Korea during the Cold War Era: 1945-91, Eberstadt presents an impressive compilation of hard-to-find comparative data on economic performance for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (ROK, or South Korea) over two critical generations. By a number of indicators, Eberstadt argues, Kim Il Sung's North Korea actually outperformed South Korea for much of this period-not only in the years immediately following partition, but perhaps also into the 1970s. To explain these surprising results, Eberstadt details the impact of government policies on the course of growth of both economies and offers some unorthodox observations about material performance under these two contending polities. He finds that prevailing economic development theory on such issues as planned-versus- market economies, military burden, and the relationship between material advance and poverty, may require reexamination in light of the experience of the two Koreas between partition and the end of the Cold War.","2010","2022-06-13 13:41:52","2022-06-13 13:41:52","","","332","","","","","Policy and Economic Performance in Divided Korea During the Cold War Era","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 72lpTkNcJQ4C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=72lpTkNcJQ4C","","History / Asia / Korea; Business & Economics / Development / Economic Development; Business & Economics / International / Economics & Trade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Counter to the received narrative, Amy Austin Holmes argues that the ousting of Mubarak in 2011 did not represent the culmination of a revolution or the beginning of a transition period, but rather the beginning of a revolutionary process that would unfold in three waves, followed by two waves of counterrevolution. This book offers the first analysis of both the revolution and counterrevolution in Egypt from January 2011 until June 2018.  The period of revolutionary upheaval played out in three uprisings against three distinct forms of authoritarian rule: the Mubarak regime and the police state that protected it, the unelected military junta known as the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, and the religious authoritarianism of the Muslim Brotherhood. The counterrevolution occurred over two periods: the first under Adly Mansour as interim president and the second after El Sisi was elected president. While the regime imprisoned or killed the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood and many secular activists during the first wave of the counterrevolution, it turned against civil society at large during the second: NGOs, charities, media, academia, and minority groups.  In addition to providing new and unprecedented empirical data, Coups and Revolutions makes two theoretical contributions. First, it presents a new framework for analyzing the state apparatus in Egypt based on four pillars of regime support that can either prop up or press upon whoever is in power. These are the Egyptian military, the business elite, the United States, and the multi-headed opposition. Secondly, the book brings together the literature on bottom-up revolutionary movements and top-down military coups, and it introduces the concept of a coup from below in contrast to the revolution from above that took place under Gamal Abdel Nasser.","2019","2022-06-13 13:39:09","2022-06-13 13:39:09","","","401","","","","","Coups and Revolutions","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: kaCgDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=kaCgDwAAQBAJ","","Philosophy / Political; Social Science / General; Political Science / Geopolitics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"YZ8695FP","book","2017","Keane, John","When Trees Fall, Monkeys Scatter: Rethinking Democracy In China","","978-1-78634-361-1","","","","Predictions of the coming collapse of Chinese politics are today commonplace, however this thought-provoking book explores a radically different alternative. China, it argues, is a one-party-dominated political system whose surprising levels of public support and resilience in the face of serious economic, environmental and social problems suggest that it is more durable than most outside observers suppose. China is not an ailing 'autocracy', a case of 'crony capitalism' or a blindly repressive 'authoritarian regime'. The rulers of China are in fact experimenting with a wide range of locally-made democratic tools designed to win the trust and loyalty of their subjects. Examples probed in this book include the injection of accountability mechanisms into state bureaucracy, the toleration of independent public opinion leaders, the growing reliance of Party officials and corporate executives on public opinion polls and 'democratic style', and the calculated use by Party officials of digitally networked media as early warning devices.Written for students and teachers, researchers and general readers fascinated by the rising global power of China, When Trees Fall, Monkeys Scatter shows why locally-made democratic practices often favour one-party rule and why China is becoming a globally significant political laboratory: a 21st century testing ground for a new type of top-down popular government at odds with power-sharing democracy as it was known during the past generation.","2017-08-04","2022-06-13 13:37:12","2022-06-13 13:37:12","","","195","","","","","When Trees Fall, Monkeys Scatter","","","","","#N/A","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: gocvDwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=gocvDwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / World / Asian","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The newly awakened interest in autocratic regimes goes hand in hand with a lack of systematic research on the results of the political and substantive policy performance of variants of autocratic regimes. The contributions in this second volume of Comparing Autocracies are united by the assumption that the performance of political regimes and their persistence are related. Furthermore, autocratic institutions and the specific configurations of elite actors within authoritarian regime coalitions induce dictators to undertake certain policies, and that different authoritarian institutions are therefore an important piece of the puzzle of government performance in dictatorships. Based on these two prepositions, the contributions explore the differences between autocracies and democracies, as well as between different forms of non-democratic regimes, in regard to their outcome performance in selected policy fields; how political institutions affect autocratic performance and persistence; whether policy performance matter for the persistence of authoritarian rule; and what happens to dictators once autocratic regimes fall.

"47I6VRFU","book","2010","McEachern, Patrick","Inside the Red Box: North Korea's Post-totalitarian Politics","","978-0-231-52680-7","","","","North Korea's institutional politics defy traditional political models, making the country's actions seem surprising or confusing when, in fact, they often conform to the regime's own logic. Drawing on recent materials, such as North Korean speeches, commentaries, and articles, Patrick McEachern, a specialist on North Korean affairs, reveals how the state's political institutions debate policy and inform and execute strategic-level decisions.Many scholars dismiss Kim Jong-Il's regime as a ""one-man dictatorship,"" calling him the ""last totalitarian leader,"" but McEachern identifies three major institutions that help maintain regime continuity: the cabinet, the military, and the party. These groups hold different institutional policy platforms and debate high-level policy options both before and after Kim and his senior leadership make their final call. This method of rule may challenge expectations, but North Korea does not follow a classically totalitarian, personalistic, or corporatist model. Rather than being monolithic, McEachern argues, the regime, emerging from the crises of the 1990s, rules differently today than it did under Kim's father, Kim Il Sung. The son is less powerful and pits institutions against one another in a strategy of divide and rule. His leadership is fundamentally different: it is ""post-totalitarian."" Authority may be centralized, but power remains diffuse. McEachern maps this process in great detail, supplying vital perspective on North Korea's reactive policy choices, which continue to bewilder the West.","2010-12-21","2022-06-13 12:17:54","2022-06-13 12:17:54","","","321","","","","","Inside the Red Box","","","","","Columbia University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=Lq8TYTgYv-sC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / International Relations / General; History / Asia / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The five regional powers--South Korea, China, Japan, Russia, and the United States--are ill-prepared for such an event, partly because of the act of planning for it would upset North Korea. However, the potential challenges of a collapse are too great to ignore. This study presents an historical and political analysis of the increasing risk that North Korea may collapse. A comparison with earlier cases suggests that triggers and indicators of collapse can be identified, including increasing cross-border information flows, defections, and the possible death or incapacitation of North Korea's leader. Further, the large and growing economic disparity between North Korea and its neighbors, South Korea and China, points to likely consequences of collapse, including possible mass migration. The study then examines the roles of South Korea, China, the U.S., Japan, and Russia in the future of the Korean peninsula; it concludes with a further consideration of the paradox of collapse planning, but argues that it would be better to run the risks entailed in the exercise than to be caught flatfooted when a collapse occurs. The analysis is based on interviews, surveys, and documents in English and Korean.","2010","2022-06-13 12:16:33","2022-06-13 12:16:33","","","201","","","","","Contingency on the Korean Peninsula","","","","","University of Texas at Austin","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: RSI8AwEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=RSI8AwEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Excerpt: Kim Jong-il, also written as Kim Jong Il, born 16 February 1941 (Soviet records) or 16 February 1942 (North Korean records), is the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). He is the Chairman of the National Defense Commission, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, the ruling party since 1948, and the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, the fourth largest standing army in the world.

Kim Jong-il's mother, Kim Jong-suk, was Kim Il-sung's first wife. Kim Jong-il's official biography states that he was born in a secret military camp on Baekdu Mountain in Japanese Korea on 16 February 1942.

This authoritative book brings together the world's leading North Korea experts to analyze both the challenges and prospects the country is facing. Drawing on the contributors' expertise across a range of disciplines, the book examines North Korea's political, economic, social, and foreign policy concerns. Considering the implications for Pyongyang's transition, it focuses especially on the transformation of ideology, the Worker's Party of Korea, the military, effects of the Arab Spring, the emerging merchant class, cultural infiltration from the South, Western aid, and global economic integration. The contributors also assess the impact of North Korea's new policies on China, South Korea, the United States, and the rest of the world. Comprehensive and deeply knowledgeable, their analysis is especially crucial given the power consolidation efforts of the new leadership underway in Pyongyang and the implications for both domestic and international politics.

"YFIWKWES","book","2015","Gandhi, Jennifer; Ruiz-Rufino, Rubén","Routledge Handbook of Comparative Political Institutions","","978-1-317-55179-9","","","","The Routledge Handbook of Comparative Political Institutions (HCPI) is designed to serve as a comprehensive reference guide to our accumulated knowledge and the cutting edge of scholarship about political institutions in the comparative context. It differs from existing handbooks in that it focuses squarely on institutions but also discusses how they intersect with the study of mass behaviour and explain important outcomes, drawing on the perspective of comparative politics. The Handbook is organized into three sections:   The first section, consisting of six chapters, is organized around broad theoretical and empirical challenges affecting the study of institutions. It highlights the major issues that emerge among scholars defining, measuring, and analyzing institutions.    The second section includes fifteen chapters, each of which handles a different substantive institution of importance in comparative politics. This section covers traditional topics, such as electoral rules and federalism, as well as less conventional but equally important areas, including authoritarian institutions, labor market institutions, and the military. Each chapter not only provides a summary of our current state of knowledge on the topic, but also advances claims that emphasise the research frontier on the topic and that should encourage greater investigation.    The final section, encompassing seven chapters, examines the relationship between institutions and a variety of important outcomes, such as political violence, economic performance, and voting behavior. The idea is to consider what features of the political, sociological, and economic world we understand better because of the scholarly attention to institutions.   Featuring contributions from leading researchers in the field from the US, UK, Europe and elsewhere, this Handbook will be of great interest to all students and scholars of political institutions, political behaviour and comparative politics.

"6IAZUV49","book","2008","Coghlan, David","Prospects from Korean Reunification","","978-1-4635-8196-1","","","","Throughout most of the 20th century, the Korean people have yearned for the establishment of an independent and unified Korea. Before World War II, this was denied to them by Japan's annexation of the Korean Peninsula in 1910. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, hopes of a unified independent Korea were again raised but soon dashed by the partitioning. Ostensibly a temporary division to expedite the surrender of Japanese forces, as wartime cooperation between occupying powers quickly developed into postwar competition, the division of Korea became permanent, and reunification hopes faded. Throughout the subsequent Korean War, both sides attempted to achieve reunification by force without decisive result, and although after 1953 reunification nominally remained on the agenda of both Koreas, in the increasingly tense environment of the Cold War, the issue received little more than token attention. The Korean desire for reunification is based on a long and proud history of unity that saw Korea develop into a culturally and ethnically homogenous country with a deep sense of national unity. This, combined with significant Chinese influence, has resulted in a Korean people with a strong adherence to the ties of family, culture, and history. Because of this background and despite decades of tension and animosity between North and South, Koreans harbor a powerful desire for reunification. To most Koreans, the current division of the peninsula is a temporary aberration that, with time, will be resolved. Attempts during the Cold War to overcome hostilities and obtain some degree of reconciliation as a first step toward reunification were not successful. In 1972 both Pyongyang and Seoul philosophically agreed that reunification would occur peacefully without foreign interference. Divergent views on how this was to be achieved stalled further progress. In 1984 similar attempts were again made but failed amid the mutual distrust and acrimony characteristic of Republic of Korea (ROK)-Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) relations throughout the Cold War. However, in the wake of German reunification, the death of Kim Il Sung in 1994, and the Korean Peninsula summit of 2000, there was a raft of predictions by scholars, commentators, and officials of not if but when reunification would occur. Most of these assessments assumed that reunification would be achieved by the absorption of North Korea by the South. Many went further and predicted when reunification would occur: in 1996 the then director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency predicted collapse within 3 years; earlier that year, the U.S. Commander in Korea forecasted collapse within ""a very short period""3 while in 1992, one academic predicted reunification ""certainly by 2000; probably 1995; possibly much sooner."" Interestingly, China did not share such expectations of North Korean collapse.","2008-04-30","2022-06-13 12:12:23","2022-06-13 12:12:23","","","30","","","","","","","","","","CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: aQr7vQAACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=aQr7vQAACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A native of the former Soviet Union, he lived as an exchange student in North Korea in the 1980s. He has studied it for his entire career, using his fluency in Korean and personal contacts to build a rich, nuanced understanding. In The Real North Korea, Lankov substitutes cold, clear analysis for the overheated rhetoric surrounding this opaque police state. After providing an accessible history of the nation, he turns his focus to what North Korea is, what its leadership thinks, and how its people cope with living in suchan oppressive and poor place. He argues that North Korea is not irrational, and nothing shows this better than its continuing survival against all odds. A living political fossil, it clings to existence in the face of limited resources and a zombie economy, manipulating great powers despite itsweakness. Its leaders are not ideological zealots or madmen, but perhaps the best practitioners of Machiavellian politics that can be found in the modern world. Even though they preside over a failed state, they have successfully used diplomacy-including nuclear threats-to extract support fromother nations. But while the people in charge have been ruthless and successful in holding on to power, Lankov goes on to argue that this cannot continue forever, since the old system is slowly falling apart. In the long run, with or without reform, the regime is unsustainable. Lankov contends thatreforms, if attempted, will trigger a dramatic implosion of the regime. They will not prolong its existence. Based on vast expertise, this book reveals how average North Koreans live, how their leaders rule, and how both survive.","2015","2022-06-13 12:11:23","2022-06-13 12:11:23","","","350","","","","","The Real North Korea","","","","","Oxford University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: FHpYCwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=FHpYCwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Asia / Korea; HISTORY / Asia / General; POLITICAL SCIENCE / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"5HCGRSIG","book","2013","Schedler, Andreas","The Politics of Uncertainty: Sustaining and Subverting Electoral Authoritarianism","","978-0-19-968032-0","","","","Dictatorship is not what it was once. Military and single-party regimes have been withering away. Today, most dictators organize multiparty elections. The Politics of Uncertainty presents an analytical framework and empirical data that allow us to understand the distinctive political dynamics of these new electoral authoritarian regimes. It argues that all autocracies suffer from institutional uncertainties: their hold on power is never secure. They also suffer from informational uncertainties: they can never know for sure how secure they are. The author identifies these uncertainties as the central axes of regimes conflicts under dictatorship. The Politics of Uncertainty comprises the struggle between rulers and dissidents over these twin uncertainties. In electoral autocracies, it unfolds primarily as competition over electoral uncertainty. The study of electoral authoritarianism is a vibrant growth industry in political science and this book is required reading for all students of elections, authoritarianism, and democratization. Oxford Studies in Democratization is a series for scholars and students of comparative politics and related disciplines.

Egypt has in recent years experienced a rise in political activism driven by increasing internal demands for reform and change, impacting upon its economic and political strategy. Two key issues have been central to this: the Muslim Brotherhood, in its evolution from a spiritual to a political movement, and the politics of succession, which has seen the grooming of Gamal Mubarak, son of President Hosni Mubarak, to usher forward the inheritance of power in Egypt. This book enables a greater understanding of the dynamics of authoritarianism and democratisation, and the challenges and dilemmas which any future Egyptian reform process will face in the context of succession to Hosni Mubarak.""--Bloomsbury publishing.","2010","2022-06-13 12:10:41","2022-06-13 12:10:41","","","202","","","","","The Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt's Succession Crisis","","","","","Tauris Academic Studies","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 0BpWzQEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=0BpWzQEACAAJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ordering Power draws on theoretical insights dating back to Thomas Hobbes to develop a unified framework for explaining both of these political outcomes. States are especially strong and dictatorships especially durable when they have their origins in 'protection pacts': broad elite coalitions unified by shared support for heightened state power and tightened authoritarian controls as bulwarks against especially threatening and challenging types of contentious politics. These coalitions provide the elite collective action underpinning strong states, robust ruling parties, cohesive militaries, and durable authoritarian regimes - all at the same time. Comparative-historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries (Burma, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Vietnam, and Thailand) reveals that subtly divergent patterns of contentious politics after World War II provide the best explanation for the dramatic divergence in Southeast Asia's contemporary states and regimes.","2010-08-09","2022-06-13 12:10:12","2022-06-13 12:10:12","","","345","","","","","Ordering Power","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: C0DI9Fr2Ak8C","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=C0DI9Fr2Ak8C","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Social Science / Sociology / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smith shows how the end of the Cold War in Europe and the famine brought radical social change to all of North Korean society. This major new study analyses how marketization transformed the interests, expectations and values of the entire society, including Party members, the military, women and men, the young and the elderly. Smith shows how the daily life of North Koreans has become alienated from the daily pronouncements of the North Korean government. Challenging stereotypes of twenty-five million North Koreans as mere bystanders in history, Smith argues that North Koreans are 'neither victims nor villains' but active agents of their own destiny.","2015-04-09","2022-06-13 12:09:26","2022-06-13 12:09:26","","","395","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 4eBwBwAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=4eBwBwAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; History / Asia / Korea; Political Science / World / Asian; Political Science / World / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"IB5YX4M9","book","2012","Svolik, Milan W.","The Politics of Authoritarian Rule","","978-1-107-02479-3","","","","What drives politics in dictatorships? Milan W. Svolik argues that all authoritarian regimes must resolve two fundamental conflicts. First, dictators face threats from the masses over which they rule - this is the problem of authoritarian control. A second, separate challenge arises from the elites with whom dictators rule - this is the problem of authoritarian power-sharing. Crucially, whether and how dictators resolve these two problems is shaped by the dismal environment in which authoritarian politics takes place: in a dictatorship, no independent authority has the power to enforce agreements among key actors and violence is the ultimate arbiter of conflict. Using the tools of game theory, Svolik explains why some dictators, such as Saddam Hussein, establish personal autocracy and stay in power for decades; why leadership changes elsewhere are regular and institutionalized, as in contemporary China; why some dictatorships are ruled by soldiers, as Uganda was under Idi Amin; why many authoritarian regimes, such as PRI-era Mexico, maintain regime-sanctioned political parties; and why a country's authoritarian past casts a long shadow over its prospects for democracy, as the unfolding events of the Arab Spring reveal. When assessing his arguments, Svolik complements these and other historical case studies with the statistical analysis of comprehensive, original data on institutions, leaders, and ruling coalitions across all dictatorships from 1946 to 2008.","2012-09-17","2022-06-13 05:29:30","2022-06-13 05:29:30","","","253","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: mcZ6pmTnIwQC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=mcZ6pmTnIwQC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Public Policy / Economic Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, many of the transition processes that could be included in the Third Wave have reached a standstill, or, at the very least, have taken a turn for the worse, leading sometimes to new forms of non-democratic regimes. As a result of these developments, the research on autocracies has experienced a revival in recent times.  This unique two-volume work aims at taking stock of recent research and providing new conceptual, theoretical, and empirical insights into autocratic rule in the early twenty-first century. It is organized into two parts. The contributions in this first volume analyse the trajectories, manifestations and perspectives of non-democratic rule in general and autocratic rule in particular. It brings together some of the leading authoritarianism scholars in Europe and North America who address three broad questions: How to conceptualize and measure forms of autocratic regimes? What determines the persistence of autocratic rule? What is the role of political institutions, legitimation, ideology, and repression for the survival of different forms of autocratic rule?

Park argues that contemporary strategic debates in East Asia are based on shared contextual knowledge - that of international hierarchy - reconstructed in the late-nineteenth century. The mechanism that reproduces this lens of hierarchy is domestic legitimacy politics in which embattled political leaders contest the meaning of sovereign autonomy. Park argues that the idea of status seeking has remained embedded in the concept of sovereign autonomy and endures through distinct and alternative security frames that continue to inform contemporary strategic debates in East Asia. This book makes a significant contribution to debates in international relations theory and security studies about autonomy and status, as well as to the now extensive literature on the nature of East Asian regional order.","2017-05-11","2022-06-13 05:25:57","2022-06-13 05:25:57","","","223","","","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: gXauDgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=gXauDgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; History / Europe / General; History / Asia / General","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The real-world importance of nuclear weapons has led to the production of a voluminous scholarly literature on the causes and consequences of nuclear weapons proliferation. Missing from this literature, however, is a more nuanced analysis that moves beyond a binary treatment of nuclear weapons possession, to an exploration of how different nuclear postures and nonproliferation policies may influence the proliferation of nuclear weapons and subsequent security outcomes. This volume addresses this deficit by focusing on the causes and consequences of nuclear postures and nonproliferation policies. It is the aim of this book to advance the development of a new empirical research agenda that brings systematic research methods to bear on new dimensions of the nuclear weapons phenomenon. Prior to the contributions in this volume, there has been little evidence to suggest that nuclear postures and policies have a meaningful impact on the spread of nuclear weapons or security outcomes. This book brings together a new generation of scholars, advancing innovative theoretical positions, and performing quantitative tests using original data on nuclear postures, nonproliferation policies, and WMD proliferation. Together, the chapters in this volume make novel theoretical, empirical, and methodological contributions to the field of nuclear weapons proliferation. This book will be of much interest to students of nuclear proliferation, international relations and security studies.","2015-10-08","2022-06-13 05:24:53","2022-06-13 05:24:53","","","324","","","","","Nonproliferation Policy and Nuclear Posture","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TzavCgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=TzavCgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / Security (National & International); Political Science / International Relations / Arms Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Foreign Policy As A Strategy To Legitimize The Kims?","","978-3-346-33096-3","","","","Seminar paper from the year 2020 in the subject Politics - International Politics - Region: South Asia, grade: 1,3, University of Heidelberg, language: English, abstract: This paper addresses a theoretical and an empirical question. First, the paper argues that general theories of comparative analysis of political systems can indeed be used to study the ""special case"" of North Korea. This addresses the question of how to conduct research on the ""hermit kingdom"". By using an established framework deductively, the paper proposes a way to conduct research on North Korea amid a lack of reliable data. North Korea is thereby seen as an extreme case of an autocracy in order that however, enables researchers to observe special structural features more explicitly than in autocracies. The implicit argument here is that North Korea is comparable to other autocracies and only varies in the strength of certain characteristics such as regime type or internal dynamics. Second, the paper investigates empirically whether autocracies use foreign policy for internal legitimation and if so, what strategies are they pursuing? This paper argues that autocrats can basically use four strategies to use foreign policy as a source of legitimation. Making use of a framework developed by Kneuer the case of North Korea is examined to illustrate the argument. A within-case analysis is used to investigate the extent to which each of the three Kims used foreign policy as a means of generating legitimation. The results suggest that all three used similar strategies but depending on their respective legitimation deficits. Overall, it is advocated to take a closer look at the influence of foreign policy on domestic dynamics. This has so far been largely neglected. This becomes particularly evident when it comes to the question of the possibilities for North Korean denuclearization. Viewed as a domestic legitimation measures, it becomes more questionable whether North Korea will abandon its weapons anytime soon.","2021-01-19","2022-06-13 05:21:25","2022-06-13 05:21:25","","","40","","","","","","","","","","GRIN Verlag","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: bwEWEAAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=bwEWEAAAQBAJ","","Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / International Relations / Diplomacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It finds that where social, economic, and technocratic ties to the West were extensive, as in Eastern Europe and the Americas, the external cost of abuse led incumbents to cede power rather than crack down, which led to democratization. Where ties to the West were limited, external democratizing pressure was weaker and countries rarely democratized. In these cases, regime outcomes hinged on the character of state and ruling party organizations. Where incumbents possessed developed and cohesive coercive party structures, they could thwart opposition challenges, and competitive authoritarian regimes survived; where incumbents lacked such organizational tools, regimes were unstable but rarely democratized.","2010-08-16","2022-06-13 05:20:02","2022-06-13 05:20:02","","","537","","","","","Competitive Authoritarianism","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: NZDI05p1PDgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=NZDI05p1PDgC","","Political Science / General; Political Science / Comparative Politics; History / Modern / 20th Century","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These conflicts could range from posturing and threats to a major conventional conflict on the Korean peninsula, with intervention by outside powers, to the extreme of nuclear conflict. The Korean balance is also affected by the uncertain mix of cooperation and competition between the United States and China, particularly with the U.S. “pivot” toward Asia and the steady modernization of Chinese forces.

"LZ246QPM","book","2009","Solingen, Etel","Nuclear Logics: Contrasting Paths in East Asia and the Middle East","","978-1-4008-2802-9","","","","Nuclear Logics examines why some states seek nuclear weapons while others renounce them. Looking closely at nine cases in East Asia and the Middle East, Etel Solingen finds two distinct regional patterns. In East Asia, the norm since the late 1960s has been to forswear nuclear weapons, and North Korea, which makes no secret of its nuclear ambitions, is the anomaly. In the Middle East the opposite is the case, with Iran, Iraq, Israel, and Libya suspected of pursuing nuclear-weapons capabilities, with Egypt as the anomaly in recent decades.Identifying the domestic conditions underlying these divergent paths, Solingen argues that there are clear differences between states whose leaders advocate integration in the global economy and those that reject it. Among the former are countries like South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, whose leaders have had stronger incentives to avoid the political, economic, and other costs of acquiring nuclear weapons. The latter, as in most cases in the Middle East, have had stronger incentives to exploit nuclear weapons as tools in nationalist platforms geared to helping their leaders survive in power. Solingen complements her bold argument with other logics explaining nuclear behavior, including security dilemmas, international norms and institutions, and the role of democracy and authoritarianism. Her account charts the most important frontier in understanding nuclear proliferation: grasping the relationship between internal and external political survival. Nuclear Logics is a pioneering book that is certain to provide an invaluable resource for researchers, teachers, and practitioners while reframing the policy debate surrounding nonproliferation.","2009-02-09","2022-06-13 04:33:19","2022-06-13 04:33:19","","","421","","","","","Nuclear Logics","","","","","Princeton University Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: A6LSzFKb1XAC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=A6LSzFKb1XAC","","Political Science / Globalization; Political Science / International Relations / Arms Control; History / Military / Nuclear Warfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many analysts argue that North Korea is a unique political system. What kind of regime is the DPRK, and what kind of leader does it have? A variety of labels are given to the North Korean regime. These include likening the regime to an organised crime family and to a corporatist organism. There are certainly merits to each of these approaches, but each has its limitations. Pyongyang does share some of the attributes of organised crime and certainly engages in criminal activity in a systematic and calculating manner. This pattern of illicit behaviour includes the production and distribution of narcotics as well as the counterfeiting of foreign currencies, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. But the DPRK is more than a crime family -- it possesses a massive conventional military force as well as significant strategic forces. Moreover, the regime continues to brainwash, imprison, or starve North Koreans, inflicting untold misery and death on its people. Corporatism, meanwhile, may provide insights into certain aspects of the system, but its utility is limited by the confusion that surrounds understanding of this concept. An absolute dictator still rules the regime.","2009","2022-06-13 04:32:00","2022-06-13 04:32:00","","","152","","","","","","","","","","Nova Science","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: 478sAQAAIAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=478sAQAAIAAJ","","Political Science / Political Process / Leadership","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Han Park explores the reasons for this resilience, concentrating on the implications of mass beliefs and political ideology for the country's political life. Park begins with an examination of Juche, or self-reliance, the ideology that so pervasively penetrates the entire spectrum of North Korean society and guides political behavior at all levels. Drawing on personal interviews and on-site observations, he finds a belief system that is comparable to a theology, and a society that exhibits many characteristics of a religious community. In this context, he discusses regime legitimacy, the economy, foreign and defense policy, and the politics of reunification, as well as the regime's reaction to the market forces of globalization. It is Juche, Park concludes, that is the locus of North Korea's political culture, central to understanding its politics and policies.

However it remains unclear how the success or failure of these sanctions is measured. This book examines the seldom-explored United Nations’ economic sanctions deliberation process and exposes systematic problems in the measurement of the success or failure of these sanctions. Centering on the key concepts of ""peace and security,"" the author brings the reader’s attention to the discrepancies that exist in the process of decision-making, implementation, and evaluation of UN imposed economic sanctions. She engages international law and development methods to provide proof for the lack of consensus in measures of success and failure, which in turn suggests that sanction implementation on a uniform domestic front are unattainable. This thorough analysis concludes with suggestions for improving the sanctions process, only to clear the path for negating them as a whole and suggest alternative non-coercive measures for mitigating conflict situations and threats to peace and security.","2013-10-08","2022-06-13 04:27:58","2022-06-13 04:27:58","","","228","","","","","A Strategic Understanding of UN Economic Sanctions","","","","","Routledge","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: fUFGAQAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=fUFGAQAAQBAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / International Relations / General; Political Science / International Relations / Treaties; Business & Economics / International / General; Law / International","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Few have chosen to engage in this Herculean task, whether out of a residual civility in not wishing to mock certain aging scholars whose research would appear curiously dated, or out of a sense of fatigue with the whole subject of casting aspersions on mistaken views. A New Europe for the Old? asks whether the master narratives that circulated so widely in the West in the half-century since 1945 remain valid. Stephen Graubard's volume raises pertinent questions regarding the current state of the European world as it has evolved since 1989.

"JCW5Y59J","book","2002","Finer, Samuel Edward","The Man on Horseback: The Role of the Military in Politics","","978-0-7658-0922-3","","","","The role of the military in a society raises a number of issues: How much separation should there be between a civil government and its army? Should the military be totally subordinate to the polity? Or should the armed forces be allowed autonomy in order to provide national security? Recently, the dangers of military dictatorships-as have existed in countries like Panama, Chile, and Argentina-have become evident. However, developing countries often lack the administrative ability and societal unity to keep the state functioning in an orderly and economically feasible manner without military intervention.Societies, of course, have dealt with the realities of these problems throughout their histories, and the action they have taken at any particular point in time has depended on numerous factors. In the ""first world"" of democratic countries, the civil-military relationship has been thoroughly integrated, and indeed by most modern standards this is seen as essential. However, several influential Western thinkers have developed theories arguing for the separation of the military from any political or social role. Samuel Huntington, emphasized that professionalism would presuppose that the military should intervene as little as possible in the political sphere. Samuel E. Finer, in contrast, emphasizes that a government can be efficient enough way to keep the civil-military relationship in check, ensuring that the need for intervention by the armed forces in society would be minimal. At the time of the book's original publication, perhaps as a consequence of a post-World War II Cold War atmosphere, this was by no means a universally accepted position. Some considered the military to be a legitimate threat to a free society. Today's post-Cold War environment is an appropriate time to reconsider Finer's classic argument.The Man on Horseback continues to be an important contribution to the study of the military's role in the realm of politics, and will be of interest to students of political science, government, and the military.","2002","2022-06-13 04:20:39","2022-06-13 04:20:39","","","268","","","","","The Man on Horseback","","","","","Transaction","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: UGlZngEACAAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=UGlZngEACAAJ","","Political Science / General; Political Science / American Government / National","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Amid escalating nuclear tensions, Kim Jong-un and North Korea's other leaders have kept a tight grasp on their one-party state, quashing any nascent opposition movements and sending all suspected dissidents to its brutal concentration camps for ""re-education."" Kang Chol-Hwan is the first survivor of one of these camps to escape and tell his story to the world, documenting the extreme conditions in these gulags and providing a personal insight into life in North Korea. Sent to the notorious labor camp Yodok when he was nine years old, Kang observed frequent public executions and endured forced labor and near-starvation rations for ten years. In 1992, he escaped to South Korea, where he found God and now advocates for human rights in North Korea. Part horror story, part historical document, part memoir, part political tract, this book brings together unassailable firsthand experience, setting one young man's personal suffering in the wider context of modern history, giving eyewitness proof to the abuses perpetrated by the North Korean regime.","2005-08-24","2022-06-13 04:18:56","2022-06-13 04:18:56","","","187","","","","","The Aquariums of Pyongyang","","","","","Hachette UK","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: JUI4DgAAQBAJ","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=JUI4DgAAQBAJ","","Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism; History / Asia / Korea; Biography & Autobiography / Historical; Political Science / Human Rights; Biography & Autobiography / Religious; Religion / Inspirational","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linz and Alfred Stepan have increasingly focused on the questions of how, in the modern world, nondemocratic regimes can be eroded and democratic regimes crafted. In Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation, they break new ground in numerous areas. They reconceptualize the major types of modern nondemocratic regimes and point out for each type the available paths to democratic transition and the tasks of democratic consolidation. They argue that, although ""nation-state"" and ""democracy"" often have conflicting logics, multiple and complementary political identities are feasible under a common roof of state-guaranteed rights. They also illustrate how, without an effective state, there can be neither effective citizenship nor successful privatization. Further, they provide criteria and evidence for politicians and scholars alike to distinguish between democratic consolidation and pseudo-democratization, and they present conceptually driven survey data for the fourteen countries studied.Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation contains the first systematic comparative analysis of the process of democratic consolidation in southern Europe and the southern cone of South America, and it is the first book to ground post-Communist Europe within the literature of comparative politics and democratic theory.","1996-08-16","2022-06-13 04:16:44","2022-06-13 04:16:44","","","508","","","","","Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation","","","","","JHU Press","","en","","","","","Google Books","","Google-Books-ID: TqRn1lAypsgC","","","https://books.google.co.uz/books?id=TqRn1lAypsgC","","Political Science / Comparative Politics; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Democracy; Political Science / Political Ideologies / Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
